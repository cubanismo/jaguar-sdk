CDBOOT.TXT 95-Aug-10 / CDBIOS Version 4.05 of 95-Aug-8
------------------------------------------------------

CDBOOT.ROM is a Jaguar program that loads into the Alpine board and 
emulates the boot process of the Jaguar CD, loading the boot code from 
the CD (or emulator) and executing it in the same fashion as if you 
were booting a bootable disc.

Essentially, from within the debugger, you load the enclosed file CDBOOT.ROM
to address $802000, then you execute the CDGO.DB script.  This script runs
the required boot sequences and under the control of the debugger runs
through the appropriate steps of a normal CD BOOT seqeunce.

The boot process then stops at the point after the CDBIOS was properly
installed at $3000, the TOC was read and the PC points at the first
instruction of the boot code that was loaded from the CD.

Please note that booting with this code DOES work from the Falcon-based CD
Emulator.  The Jaguar CD's built-in VLM program is NOT supported by the
Falcon Emulation because of the way VLM data is handled.  Data rate and error
handling restrictions of the emulator do, of course, still apply.  However,
this should nevertheless be a huge help for your debugging efforts.

If you apply FILEFIX on your bootcode and then load the symbols for your boot
code after the boot process reaches its breakpoint, you can have all your
symbols available and debug the code that was actually loaded from the CD.
