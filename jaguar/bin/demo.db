# This is an example of how to open a user defined window.
# rdb.rc should call the 'wlg' procedure, then the user can
# use it by entering 'lg2' under the shell window.

# NOTE: dsize contains the number of bytes that were used by the last
# disassembly call. 'lg2' uses it to update its next display, but it
# leads to a scrolling disassembly while resizing the user window. No
# idea about how to fix it today. (Brainstorm 04/04/94)
