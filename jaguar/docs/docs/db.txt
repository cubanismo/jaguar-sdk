*******************************************************************************
Please note that the files ADDENDUM.RDB, RDBJAG.TXT, ADDENDUM.WDB, and
WRDBJAG.TXT have been merged into RDB.TXT.  There is now just a single file
for both WDB and RDBJAG.
*******************************************************************************

Please note that this file refers to both RDBJAG and WDB.  RDBJAG is the
TTY-based interface version of DB.  WDB is the windows, menus, & mouse
version of DB.  References to "DB" apply equally to both RDBJAG and WDB.
Where only one or the other is specified, the text applies only to that
specific version.



Notes on DB:
-------------
  DB expects a bidirectionnal parallel port on LPT1, LPT2 or LPT3.  If you
  have other monodirectionnal parallel port(s), it will automatically
  recognize the right one.  If you have more than one bidirectionnal port and
  the Jaguar is not on the first one, you can tell DB which port to use.  The
  switch is -p (-p1 -p2 or -p3).


DB Feature Additions/Changes
----------------------------
  This contains all the new options for DB (PC/DOS, PC/Linux & Atari/TOS
  versions) made since the PC version was released:


New command line options:
-------------------------
${DB} refers to either WDB or RDBJAG.


${DB} [-...] <filename>

	where filename is the name of a .COF file will perform an "aread"
	operation on <filename>.  The .COF extension may be omitted.

${DB} [-...] <filename>

	where filename is the name of a .ABS file will perform an "aread"
	operation on <filename>. The .ABS extension may be omitted.

${DB} [-...] <filename>.DB

	will perform an "load" operation on <filename>.DB.
	Note that the .DB extension must be entered.

${DB} [-...] <filename>.ROM

	will perform an "fread" operation on <filename>.ROM to $802000.
	Note that the .ROM extension must be entered.

${DB} -g

	will perform an automatic "go" command after processing commandline.
	This is usually used with a program/script name, like:
	rdbjag -g <myprog>

${DB} -q

	will perform auto quit.  This is usually used with -g, like:
	rdbjag -g -q <myprog>

${DB} -o

	will perform auto gag on.  This is usually used with -g and -q, like:
	rdbjag -o -g -q <myprog>.

${DB} -p[n] [-d]

	Specifies that a specific parallel port should be used, and that DB
	should not try using other ports: "-p1" specifies LPT1, "-p2"
	specifies LPT2, and "-p3" specifies LPT3.

	By default, DB will test all your parallel ports.  It assumes the
	first 8-bit bidirectional port found is the Jaguar one.  Note that
	this test may trash the configuration of other parallel boards and
	could lead the printer to malfunction.  (This should not happen, but
	who knows..).

	The "-d" switch, used with the "-p" switch, tells DB to not test the
	parallel port at all and just assume that it is really bidirectional.
	Use it to avoid problems with other printer ports or if your parallel
	board is not recognized correctly.  (For instance I use 'rdbjag -p1
	-d turtdemo.abs' to force DB to use LPT1.)


Line editing and Prompt:
------------------------
  New line editing with arrows, delete, scrolling and history.  A prompt now
  appears on each line .  'Db:' for standard input, 'Proc:' for procedure
  input and 'Set:' for setting values input.  There is no history for the two
  last modes.  The history size is 100 lines for standard input.  Use up and
  down arrow keys to get history.  Line editing uses right and left arrow
  keys, DEL, BS, Home and End under PC, Shift-Left and Shift-Right under TOS.

  In RDBJAG or the console window of WDB, the TAB key now completes the
  expression in input from the cursor position.  If there is no space before
  the cursor position, it will try to complete from the commands table, if
  there is a command before the cursor position, it will complete the word
  under the cursor from whatever the command is about (i.e: 'aread turt<TAB>'
  will expand in 'aread turtdemo.abs', and 'help are<TAB>' will expand in
  'help aread').  Pressing the TAB key twice in succession will show all
  possible matches if more than one is possible ('a la' gdb).

  The expansion feature of the TAB key will work on command names,
  procedure names, alias names, symbol names, module names and file names
  depending on the command firstly typed (or none).

  The `bind' feature is no longer allowed for the Backspace, Control + @,
  TAB, ESC, Home, and End keystrokes as these keys are now used for line
  editing purposes.


New `aread' function:
-------------------
  To avoid the absolute necessity of the FILEFIX step after linking is done,
  the `aread' function is provided. It loads a .ABS or .COF file directly
  from the command line. The syntax is only 'aread filename'. Note that the
  file extension may be omitted. This function can also be called directly
  from the DOS (TOS) command line simply by entering the filename of the
  .ABS or .COF file after <rdbjag>. Recognized files are DRI absolute file
  format or COFF file format.


New `z' function:
---------------
  This will skip the next CPU instruction.

  `z' <count> will skip the next <count> instructions.


New `reset' and `halt' functions:
-----------------------------
  If your Alpine board supports it, this will either RESET or HALT the
  Jaguar M68K (as you can do with corresponding buttons). Only works on
  PC/DOS and PC/Linux.


New `fread' function.
-------------------
  Same as `read', but can be fast with 'pprot'>=0.


New `suspend' function under Atari/TOS and PC/Linux:
--------------------------------------------------
  This will suspend DB. Restart with `fg'.


New `listsym' function:
---------------------
  It prints on one line all the symbols that are at the given address, or at
  the current cpu PC.


New `objlist' function:
---------------------
  Displays the object list starting from its argument.  WDB also now has a
  new Object List display window that displays the contents of an object
  list and allows the user to change values.


New source-level handling:
--------------------------
  Some new functions have been added for source-level handling:

  - `ls' is the same function as `l', but lists the source code instead of
  disassembly.  Usage is:

		ls <addr> prints the source corresponding to <addr>
		ls :<#>    prints the current source file from line <#>
		ls <fname>:<#> same as above for source file <fname>
		ls <fname>: prints source file <fname> from current line #.

  - `mlist' prints a list of all source files loaded in memory

  - `mpurge' unloads source file(s) for small memory configurations.  Usage is:

	  `mpurge' <fname> will purge source file <fname> from memory.
	  `mpurge' * will purge all source files from memory.

  - `n' will step in until the next source line.

  The 5 commands below may be only used after having 'aread' in a COF file
  containing at least one C source compiled by GCC with '-g' and linked by
  ALN with '-g2'. Please note that you should also use ALN dated 08-may-1995
  or newer, otherwise you will have wrong values for statics.

  - `ceval' [/radix] <expr> evaluates a C expression.
	The C evaluator is ANSI C compliant with the following changes:
	- doesn't allow function calls
	- allow characters constant up to one long (e.g 'a' up to 'abcd')
	- allow pointer setting with no casting (e.g "ptr=0x4000")

  - `cvars' [/radix] [var [var] ...] displays all C variables currently in scope
	or the given argument[s].

  - `cgvars' [/radix] [var [var] ...] displays all global C variables
	or the given argument[s].

  - `cfvars' [/radix] [var [var] ...] displays all file C variables
	or the given argument[s].

  - `clvars' [/radix] [var [var] ...] displays all local C variables
	or the given argument[s].

  The optional radix modifier may be one of:
  s (signed decimal)
  u (unsigned decimal)
  h or x (hexadecimal)
  c (character)
  d (default)

  E.g: cvars /c MyString /h MyArray
  will display MyString using character display and MyArray using hex display.

  Everywhere an address can be entered in DB, you now can also use debug
  symbols.  For example one can enter 'ls main' to list the source code from
  the 'main' label, or 'l main' to disassemble from the 'main' label. It is
  also better to enter 'ls main' or 'l main' even if you mean '_main'.

  When DB finds source-level informations in a .ABS file, some functions
  will add source informations to their outputs:

	- after registers display (eg: 'x' but also 't', 'g' etc...).

	- the 'b' command recognizes the same syntax as 'ls'.

	- in breakpoints list.

  The "tabstop" variable has been added.  One can change it with "set tabstop
  #" (# is the new tab value).  This is used in source level and disassembly
  displays (at least).  Default value: 8.

  The "disaddr" variable has been added.  It contains the current disassembly
  address ('l' and 'l disaddr' do the same).

  The "dissize" variable has been added.  It contains the current disassembly
  size.  (Useful mainly in scripts).

  The "dislab" variable has been added.  0 means old fashion labels
  disassembly.  (See below: Changes from old rdbjag).  Default: 1.

  The "dislnb" variable has been added.  It contains the disassembly and
  source level lines number.  Default: 10.

  The "srclevel" variable has been added.  It forbids source level management
  if set to 0.  Default: 1.  (Wish from Robert Dibley @ Rebellion Software).

  The "frameptr" variable has been added.  It contains the C stack pointer
  register number (default: @14=A6). If you're using -fomit-frame-pointer,
  then you must set 'frameptr' to @15 (A7). This variable is used when
  displaying a C stacked local or parameter variable.


New miscellaneous variables:
----------------------------
  The "pprot" variable has been added.  It handles the time loop for the new
  parallel protocol.  May vary from -1 to 5.  Default: 3.

  -1 means "old" protocol (slow).
   0 means new fast protocol handshaked version.
   1 means new fast protocol half/handshaked version with delay 1.
   2 to 5 means new fast protocol half/handshaked version with delay 2 to 5.

  The "gpurtmp" variable contains the temporary register to use for GPU
  context.

  The "dsprtmp" variable contains the temporary register to use for DSP
  context.

  The "gpubase" variable contains -1 if not GPU/DSP context is wanted, 0 if
  it is wanted or an address to use for storing the GPU stub code.


Various changes from the old DB
-------------------------------

- Breakpoints and checkpoints are now deleted from the Stub each time
  DB is launched.

- A pager has been added when more than one page is to be displayed.
  Hitting 'Q' or 'Ctrl-C' will abort the command output.

- A '>' has been added in disassembly mode.  It shows the actual 68K PC
  value.  (It is also present in source level mode).  It is switched to '^'
  or 'v' before a branch instruction if it will branch.

- A '@' has been added in disassembly mode.  It means that there is a
  breakpoint at this address.  (It is also present in source level mode).

- Labels may be now integrated into the disassembly.  I.e:

	move.l	$12345678,$87654321	LAB1, LAB2	;old fashion
	move.l	LAB1,LAB2				;new fashion

  Set the variable 'dislab' to 1 if you want new fashion.

  - Maybe some more, I forgot.  Find them and win a pack of beer :-)


New multi-processor handling:
-----------------------------
  The variable `ctxtcpu' holds the current CPU number used in `t', `g', `z'
  etc... (see script file "ngpu.db").

  The GPU registers are `gr0' ... `gr31', `ga0' ... `ga31', `gpc', `gccr',
  `gsr.

  The DSP registers are `dr0' ... `dr31', `da0' ... `da31', `dpc', `dccr',
  `dsr'.



WDB User-Interface Features
---------------------------
WDB features a completely new character-based user interface that allows
multiple overlapping windows, pull-down menus, and the use of the mouse.

Menu Bar
--------

  The menu bar is available by right-clicking the mouse on the very top line
  of the screen, or by pressing the <alt> key.  Keyboard shortcuts for menu
  items are <alt><letter>, where <letter> is shown in the menu in red upper
  case.
  Under PC/Linux, the <alt> alone key feature is replaced by <alt> Space.

	The menus are:

File:		Aread *.COF
		Aread *.ABS
		Load *.DB
		Read *.DAT
		Reload
		Load WDB.RC
		Save WDB.RC
		Quit

Context:	Trace
		Overtrace
		Verbose trace
		Verbose overtrace
		Next
		Skip
		Go
		Go Until
		Continue
		Wait
		Stop
		Reset

Open:		Registers	->	M68K,GPU,DSP
		Disassembly	->	M68K,GPU,DSP
		Memory dump
		Source level	->	M68K,GPU,DSP
		Symbols
		Breakpoints	->	M68K,GPU,DSP
		Checkpoints
		Modules
		Directory
		Cpus
		Objects list
		C variables	->	Watches,Local,File,Global symbols

Window:		Close
		Full
		Iconify
		Duplicate
		Lock
		Cycle
		Close all
		Iconify all
		-----------
		<List of first 10 opened windows. Choose one to activate.>

Activate:	<List of opened windows if more than 10. Choose one to activate.>
	
Top:		Menu choices are specific to the currently topped window.

  Hierarchical submenus are also available from certain menu items.  These
  are typically used to select between M68K, GPU, or DSP related displays
  for things like the Registers window.

  In the rest of the documentation, we will refer to a specific menu item in
  a specific menu like this: "Open->Registers".  This refers to the
  "Registers" menu item in the "Open" menu.  "Open->Registers->GPU" would
  refer to the "GPU" submenu item of the "Open->Registers" menu item.

  The commands represented by most menu items often correspond to the same
  commands you can use in RDBJAG or in WDB's console window.



Windows
-------

  Overview
  --------
  The number of windows is constrained by you hard disk size :=).  Windows
  are not bound to screen (except screen top).

  Window Appearance
  -----------------
  A window is built as:

  - an upper border containing the title bar:

	[close] <window number>:<title> [<lock>] ... [duplicate][iconify][full]

  - a left border where you can click to resize the window horizontally.

  - a right border where you can click to resize the window horizontally.

  - a bottom border where you can click to resize the window vertically.

  - at the bottom right corner or top left corner, you can click the mouse to
  resize the window both horizontally and vertically.

  [close]		closes the window.

  <window number>	the window's number starting from 0 (which is always
			the console window).

  <title>		the window's title.

  [<lock>]		an optional lock expression.

  [duplicate]		duplicates the window.

  [iconify]		toggles icon/normal mode.

  [full]		toggles full/normal mode.

  No resizing is allowed when iconified.



Windows management
------------------

  1) Mouse: The mouse operates about like you would expect if you have any
  significant experience in using a mouse.  You left click on window gadgets
  to activate their function.  If the window is not topped, this will
  automtically top it, unless you also held down the right button.

  Double-clicking on a window's title/move bar has the same effect as
  clicking on its fuller gadget.

  Double-clicking on an iconified window uniconifies it.

  An "autofocus" mouse behaviour is obtained by setting the `autofocus'
  internal variable to something != 0.


  2) Keyboard: Inside the console window, most keystrokes work the same way
  as they do in RDBJAG.  In other windows, however, some keystrokes are used
  for window management.  Pressing [Esc] while in console window will lead
  you to "Windows Keyboard Control" mode.  In this mode, some keys are
  active:

  [Tab]			goto next window.

  [*],[/],[+],[-]	resize window.

  [1] ~ [9] - [5]	move window.

  [0]			full/unfull window.

  [.]			icon/unicon window.

  [5]			duplicate window.

  [Esc]			quit Windows Keyboard Control mode and return to
		        console window.

  [Alt][1]~[9]		goto window 1~9.


  When a window other than the Console window is topped, then pressing the
  shortcut key for items shown in the "Top" menu will result in
  that command being executed immediately, even if the menu is not shown.
  You do not need to press {Return}. For example, pressing "t" while the
  Disassembly window is topped will result in a single instruction being
  <T>race'ed. Shortcuts for hierarchical submenus are not following that
  behaviour if they don't have their own default action, of course.
  Also, the Directory window will move to the first file beginning with the
  keystroke.

Default windows:
----------------

  0:Console window:
  -----------------
  The console window emulates RDBJAG's behaviour in most respects.  One major
  difference is that when a context switch is detected (i.e.  the stop button
  is pressed or a breakpoint is reached), the register values, program
  counter, and other such information are not printed in the console window.
  Instead, this information is updated in the other windows on screen as
  appropriate, such as refreshing the register window with the current
  values.  (The actual printing can be controled via the 'xenable' variable.)


  1:Registers (xxx) window: Shows the register values for a given processor.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The register window can display the values of either the M68K, GPU, or DSP
  processors.  In M68K mode, A7 means SSP.

  Left-Clicking on a register value allows you to change the value.

  The "Top" menu items shown when this window is topped are:

	<M>68k registers		Display M68K registers
	<G>pu registers			Display GPU registers
	<D>sp registers			Display DSP registers

  Pressing the shortcut key for a menu item while the menu is not shown
  will result in that command being executed immediately.  You do not need
  to press {Return}.


  2:Disassembly (xxx) window: Contains a disassembly listing.
  -----------------------------------------------------------
  The disassembly window shows an assembly language disassembly of the
  program code starting at a specific address.

  Left-Clicking in the address field at the left of the window allows you
  to set the start address.

  Left-Clicking in the column to the right of the address field allows you to
  set or remove (toggle) a breakpoint (M68K only).

  The "Top" menu items shown when this window is topped are:

	<A>ddress start			Set start address
	<B>reakpoint toggle		Toggle breakpoint (M68K only)
	-----------------------
	<T>race	into			Step into
	<O>ver trace			Step over (M68K only)
	<S>kip next instruction
	<G>o
	Go <U>ntil address		(M68K only)
	<H>alt execution
	-----------------------
	<J>ump to top of window
	<W>atch branch address
	-----------------------
	<C>hange to			->	M68K,GPU,DSP


  3:Memory dump window: Contains a memory dump
  --------------------------------------------
  This window shows the contents of memory in either byte, word, or long word
  format, starting from a specified address.

  Left-Clicking in the address field allows you to set the start address for
  the display.  Left-clicking in the hex field or ASCII fields allows you to
  to enter editing mode mode where you can change the contents of the
  specified memory locations.  In the hex field you can type in new hex
  values.  In the ASCII field you can type new characters.  The <Tab> key
  will allow you to go back and forth between the Hex and ASCII fields.  To
  leave Edit mode, press <Esc>.

  The "Top" menu items shown when this window is topped are:

	<A>ddress start		Set start address
	---------------
	<F>ind value		Find a value
	<N>ext value		Find next occurence
	---------------
	<B>yte format		Set display type to byte.
	<W>ord format		Set display type to word.
	<L>ong format		Set display type to long.
	---------------
	<E>dit memory		Enter edit mode



  4:Source level window
  ---------------------
  This window shows the contents of the program's source code.  Normally, the
  source code for the instruction at the current program counter is shown,
  but you can press <a> or left-click in the top line of the window to change
  address/filename/line number.  If you press <B> or left-click in the column
  to the right of the line numbers field, you can toggle a breakpoint.

  The "Top" menu items shown when this window is topped are:

	<A>ddress start			Set start address
	---------------
	<N>ext				Step until next line
	<G>o
	<U>ntil address			Go until address (M68K only)
	<H>alt execution		Halt execution
	----------------
	<C>hange to			-> M68K,GPU,DSP


  5:Symbols window
  ----------------
  This window lists the program's debugging symbols.  You can left-click or
  use the cursor keys to move the display.

  Double-clicking or pressing <Enter> while the cursor is on a symbol name
  will open a new memory dump window to display the contents of memory at the
  address specified by the symbol value.

  To sort the symbol list, left-click on one of the list titles at the top
  of the window. Left-click on an already selected list title to show the
  symbols without any sorting.

  The "Top" menu items shown when this window is topped are:

	<D>isassembly		Open a new disassembly window starting from
				the highlighted symbol's value.
	<M>emory dump		Open a new memory dump window starting from
				the highlighted symbol's value.
	<S>ource level		Open a new source level window starting from
				the highlighted symbol's value.


  6:Breakpoints window
  --------------------
  This window displays a list of the current breakpoints.  Left-click or use
  the cursor keys to move the cursor.

  The "Top" menu items shown when this window is topped are:

	<A>dd breakpoint		Add a new breakpoint.
	<R>emove breakpoint		Remove a breakpoint.
	<D>elete all breakpoints	Delete all breakpoints.
	------------------------
	<C>hange to			->	M68K,GPU,DSP



  7:Checkpoints window
  --------------------
  This window displays a list of the current memory checkpoints.  Left-click
  or use arrow keys to move the cursor.

  The "Top" menu items shown when this window is topped are:

	<A>dd checkpoint	  	Add a new checkpoint.
	<R>emove checkpoint		Remove a checkpoint.
	<D>elete all checkpoints	Delete all checkpoints.


  8:Modules window
  ----------------
  This window lists the program's source code modules.  Left-click or use
  arrow keys to move the cursor.  Double-click or press enter to open a
  corresponding source level window.

  The "Top" menu items shown when this window is topped are:

	<O>pen module		Open the highlighted module.
	<P>urge module		Purge the highlighted module.
	<A>ll purge			Purge all modules.


  9:Directory window
  ------------------
  This window allows you to browse files in a directory. Directories and
  drive letters are shown in upper case.  Left-click or use arrow keys
  to move the cursor.  Double-click or press enter on a file to "aread" it,
  "load" it, or "read" it (the action depends on the file extension of the
  file selected). Double-click or press enter on a directory to enter it.

  Single-click on the top line (containing the path) to change file mask
  selection (default is *). Double-click on the top line (containing the
  browsed path) to change the current directory.

  The "Top" menu items shown when this window is topped are:

	<F>ile mask			Set file mask selection.
	<S>et cwd			Set DB's current working directory.

  When a key is pressed, the display will move to the first file beginning with
  it.


  A:CPUs window

New WDB Script Language functions
---------------------------------
  DB features a powerful scripting language that allows you to write
  project-specific debugging features and customize and enhance your
  debugging environment.  The addition of windows to WDB calls for new
  script commands so that you can create and integrate your own windows
  into the WDB environment.

  Below is a list of new script commands available in WDB:

	WINDLIST	will list currently opened windows.
	WINDOPEN	will open a new window.
	WIND2TOP	will top an opened window.
	WINDMOVE	will move an opened window.
	WINDSIZE	will resize an opened window.
	WINDFULL	will toggle the window to its maximum size
	WINDICON	will iconify/uniconify an opened window.
	WINDDUPL	will duplicate an opened window.
	WINDLOCK	will lock an expression to an window
	WINDCLSE	will close an opened window.

  All functions take as their first argument the window number, except
  WINDLIST, WINDOPEN, and (eventually) WINDLOCK.

  The syntax for each of these new functions is shown below:

  WINDLIST	(no argument)
  ---------------------------
  Lists the currently open windows, using the syntax for the WINDOPEN
  function.



  WINDOPEN	<type> [<x> <y> <w> <h>] ["expression"]
  or
  WINDOPEN	<"title"> <x> <y> <w> <h> <proc_name> ["expression"]
  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  Opens a new window of the specified type at the specified location.

  The first form allows you to open a standard DB window type.  It calls for
  a window type code, optionally followed by values for the initial window
  position and size, and an expression that will be re-evaluated to provide
  the window contents (such as the starting address for a memory dump
  window) which is called the 'lock' expression.

  The second form allows you to create custom window types.  It calls for a
  window title, an initial size and position (not optional in the second
  form) and the name of a window procedure.  You can also optionally provide
  a lock expression.

  The 'type' parameter required by the first form specifies what sort of
  window is to be opened.  It should be one of:

	1: M68K registers window
	2: M68K disassembly window
	3: memory dump window
	4: source level window
	5: symbols window
	6: breakpoints window
	7: checkpoints window
	8: modules window
	9: directory window
	A: cpus window
	B: objects list window
	C: C variables window

  The parameters 'x', 'y', 'w', and 'h' are optional in the first form of
  WINDOPEN but required in the second form.  They specify the initial
  location and size (in characters) of the new window.  After it is open, the
  window may be moved and/or sized like any other.

  The parameter "expression" is optional.  When used with the first form of
  WINDOPEN, the 'x', 'y', 'w', and 'h' parameters must be provided as well.
  The "expression" parameter must be a valid DB expression.  It will be
  reevaluated every time a context switch happens, with the results shown in
  the window.  Note that the "Disassembly" and "Source Level" window types
  are default locked to the program counter address of the appropriate
  processor.  For example:

     windopen 3 0 5 5 5 "a0"

  would open a new memory dump window starting in column 0, line 5, that
  would be 5 columns wide and 5 columns tall (including the window gadgets).
  The contents of the window would be locked to M68K register a0.  Whenever
  a context switch occurs, the memory starting at the location contained in
  a0 would be shown in the window.

  In the second form of WINDOPEN, the "expression" parameter is used to
  provide an argument to the DB script procedure specified by the 'proc_name'
  parameter (see below).

  The "title" parameter is an ASCII string that will be used as the title for
  the new window.

  The 'proc_name' parameter is the name of a DB script procedure that will be
  responsible for updating the contents of the window.  This procedure will
  be called on to update the window whenever a context switch occurs.
  For example:

	windopen "my title" x y w h myproc "d0"

  The 'myproc' procedure would be defined somewhere else in the same script
  or in a separately loaded script, or even entered interactively in the
  console window. It might look like this:

	procedure myproc val
		print "My Information says that d0 = " -d `val
	.

  Note that once the "myproc" procedure output is tied to the window using
  WINDOPEN, then the output of that procedure will always go to that window,
  not just when called from a context switch update.  The output will go to
  the window even if the procedure is called directly from the Console
  window's "DB:" prompt.

  For examples of using WINDOPEN, please see the sample script WINS.DB.

  WARNING: If the procedure specified for a window is endless, it will not
  work properly and you will have to abort with <Control-C>.  For instance,
  the standard script "od.db" would not work properly inside a window.


  WIND2TOP	<num>
  -------------------
  Moves the window specified by 'num' to the top of all windows.


  WINDMOVE	<num> <dx> <dy>
  -----------------------------
  Moves the window specified by 'num' by the number of columns specified by
  'dx' and the number of rows specified by 'dy'.


  WINDSIZE	<num> <dx> <dy>
  -----------------------------
  Changes the size of the window specified by 'num' by the number of
  columns specified by 'dx' and the number of rows specified by 'dy'.


  WINDFULL	<num>
  -------------------
  Toggles the window specified by 'num' between full-size and normal-size.
  If the window is not full-screen, it will expand to fill the whole screen.
  If the window is already full-screen, it will return to its previous size.


  WINDICON	<num>
  -------------------
  Iconifies an open window or restores an iconified window.  The
  window number is specifed by the 'num' parameter.


  WINDUPL	<num>
  -------------------
  Creates a duplicate of the window specified by the 'num' parameter.


  WINDLOCK	[<num> <expression>]
  ----------------------------------
  Locks the contents of the window specified by 'num' to the expression
  specified by the "expression" parameter.  The "expression" parameter must
  be a valid DB expression.  For example:

	windlock 3 "a0+4"

  would lock the contents of window #3 to the result of the expression
  "a0+4".  If this was a memory dump window, it would lock the display to
  show whatever was 4 bytes past where register a0 was pointing.

  If "expression" is not specified, this will unlock the window 'num'.

  If "num" and "expression" are not specified, this will print a list of
  locked windows.


  WINDCLSE	<num>
  -------------------
  Closes the window specified by the 'num' parameter.



New WDB Variables
-----------------
  WDB also has a number of new variables that allow your scripts to find out
  things about the current screen display.  These variables are all
  read-only and may not be modified by your scripts.

   screenw
   -------
   This contains the screen width in characters.


   screenh
   -------
   This contains the screen height in characters.


   windnum
   -------
   This contains the number of the current window.  (Inside a window
   procedure, this is the number of the window currently being printed.)


   windmsg
   -------
   This is the current window message code (codes are listed in WINC.DB).


   windw
   -----
   This is the width in characters of the current window.  (Inside a window
   procedure, this refers to the window currently being printed.)


   windh
   -----
   This is the height in characters of the current window.  (Inside a window
   procedure, this refers to the window currently being printed.)


   autofocus
   ---------
   This controls the "autofocus" mouse behaviour.



Startup Script File for WDB
---------------------------
   At startup, immediately after looking for, loading, and executing the
   RDB.RC file, WDB searches for the script file WDB.RC.

   This file should contain "windopen" commands that will enable creation of
   any required windows at startup time.  Only the console window is created
   before its execution.  If the WDB.RC file is not found, WDB opens a
   standard screen containing window types 1, 2 and 3.

   The "File" menu has options for "Load WDB.RC" and "Save WDB.RC" which
   allow you to load a window configuration script or save your current
   window configuration to a script.






Things to remember about DB:
----------------------------
   In order to have symbol names longer than 8 characters, you MUST use the
   "-fb" option with MADMAC and the "-e" option with ALN.  (Please see
   corresponding documentation for MADMAC and ALN.)

   In order to have the source level in your programs, you MUST use the "-fb"
   and "-g" options with MADMAC and the "-e" and "-g" options with ALN.
   Additionally, the source files must be accessible when you run DB.
   (Please see corresponding documentation for MADMAC and ALN.)

   GPU/DSP source-level debugging features are now available.  Bear in mind
   that your program may have many different GPU or DSP modules which are
   designed to execute in the same address space at different times.
   Unforunately, the debugger has no way of knowing which symbol names and
   source code belong to the code which has been copied to that address space
   (typically the internal RAM of the GPU or DSP) and is being executed at at
   any given time.  Currently no good solution for dealing with this problem
   exists.  If you happen to think of one, by all means let us know!

   In order to have DB locate files (such as scripts) in any other directory
   than the current one, you must set RDBPATH to the directory you want.
   Typically this is \JAGUAR\BIN.

  text input box.


02-may-1995
-----------
+ WDB: Added "Sort by ->" menu option to C variables window.

- DOS: Removed '-m486' compile option for 386 users.


30-apr-1995
-----------
+ WDB: Enhanced C variables window.


27-apr-1995
-----------
+ WDB: Finished C variables window.
  In order to use the C variables source level, you must give -g2
  instead of -g to ALN, otherwise this debugging info will be stripped.

+ `ceval',`cvars',`clvars',`cfvars',`cgvars' added.


20-apr-1995
-----------
+ WDB: Update the default open coordinates when a window of one type is
  closed, so that the next time a window of that type is opened, it
  opens the same.

+ WDB: TOS: Fixed Directory window problems (libc's 'chdir' not working).


17-apr-1995
-----------
- WDB: The CCR field of a branch object was opened with only 2 bits.

+ Added CCR name in branch object display.


12-apr-1995
-----------
- PC/DOS: Removed GCC option -fomit-frame-pointer which seems to fail under
  DPMI (WIN31 and WINNT).  (Was added on 10-apr-1995).

+ WDB: Finished new submenus management, begin to use it for CPU choice.


10-apr-1995
-----------
+ Slightly changed command-line completion in order to have a more direct
  completion.

+ Restricted command-line usage to each machine.

= WDB: Continue to change menu management for submenus support.


06-apr-1995
-----------
- WDB: Fixed a bug when trying to select the window menu by using Alt-name
  instead of Alt-T, e.g.  Alt-R for Registers window.  Bug report by Eric
  Gaudet @ Artifice.


03-apr-1995
-----------
- Few potential bug fixes, checked under Linux with Checker 0.6 from
  Tristan Gingold (gingold@amoco.saclay.cea.fr).

+ Changed branch object dump to another "logical" manner.  Requested by
  Eric Gaudet @ Artifice.

+ Added index # and 'branch to' index # in objlist command.

- WDB: Fixed a pb in dump command (same as 20-jan-1995 fix in dump window).


02-apr-1995
-----------
+ Linux: Complete rewriting of keyboard management using the new kernel
  fcntls.  Now requires kernel 1.1.91 or later.

- DOS: GO32 release 1.12m3 is now used as DOS extender.  Was crashing under
  Windows NT and probably Windows 95.  Reported and fixed by Brian McGroarty
  @ High Voltage Software.  However, it doesn't seem possible to use a
  bidirectional // port in a DOS application under Windows NT.  Don't know
  for Windows 95.

+ WDB: Changed menu handling in order to allow sub-menus (not yet done).

+ WDB: Removed last '\n' from Usage message.


31-mar-1995
-----------
+ WDB: Added direct keyboard shortcuts in Modules window.


27-mar-1995
-----------
- Fixed intermittent time display problems in aread and fread under PC/DOS.


19-mar-1995
----------------
- WDB: Removed spurious cursor when going from one menu window to another when
  Console window is top.


18-mar-1995
-----------
+ If DB is given a filename with a ".ROM" (either upper or lowercase)
  suffix in the command line, it will 'fread' it to $802000.


14-mar-1995
-----------
+ WDB: Object list window done.


03-mar-1995
-----------
+ The 'read' and 'fread' commands now take $802000 as default addr to read
  to, if you don't provide one.


02-mar-1995
-----------
+ WDB: Changed double-click management inside windows.

+ WDB: Reduced Console window default size to 11 lines.

= WDB: Menu entry selection is now green.

= WDB: File selection in Directory window is now green.


01-mar-1995
-----------
- Added missing '.' between integer and fractional part of HSCALE display.


24-feb-1995
-----------
- WDB: Linux: Added a fflush(stdout) after mouse-selecting a file in Directory
  window.


20-feb-1995
-----------
= WDB: Linux: Recompiled with new gpm 0.97 lib/header, because it didn't work
  with it any more (same for Midnight Commander, BTW).

! WDB: Linux: WARNING: You MUST now have gpm 0.97 in order to use wdb,
  since it is incompatible with older versions.  You can find it on our BBS.
  Thanks to Jeremy Gordon @ Hyper Image Productions, Inc.


19-feb-1995
-----------
+ Added 'objlist' command that displays an object list.  Should replace the
  'od.db' script.  It has at least one advantage: it doesn't stop displaying
  the list at the first stop object.


22-jan-1995
-----------
+ Added 'listsym' command: prints on one line all the symbols that are at
  the given address, or at the current cpu PC.  Wish of Scott E. Corley @
  High Voltage.


21-jan-1995
-----------
- DB now handles COFF files with more than 3 sections (this cannot happen
  with ALN).  However, it is not possible to make DB understand COFF symbols,
  only BSD ones.  Also, it will not handle section names longer than 8 chars.
  Bug report by Jamie @ Rebellion.


20-jan-1995
-----------
- WDB: Fixed a pb in dump window, was not displaying good values after the
  1024th byte (only happened in more than 80x50).

- WDB: Fixed a pb when a message containing whitespaces is displayed in the
  console window in background.  It was doing a CR after each whitespace.


19-jan-1995
-----------
= WDB: Changed back File/"About" entry to "Information" because the shortcut is
  unpleasant.

- WDB: Linux: added a "Reset colors" to "CLS" after 'suspend' or '!'.  Still
  lacks a fflush(stdout) when you come back to WDB on the last line of
  console window, the first line and a half of console window is grey until
  you do something ...  Bug report by Dan @ Rebellion.


18-jan-1995
-----------
+ WDB: Added a close gadget to console window, which acts the same as File/Quit
  menu option.  Suggestion of Mike Beaton.

= WDB: Changed File/"Informations" entry to "About ...".  Suggestion of Mike
  Beaton.

- WDB: Fixed Checkpoints window: It had no gadgets!

- WDB: Fixed User windows: they had no gadgets!


17-jan-1995
-----------
+ WDB: Added a sort option to Symbols window.  Simply click on the title you
   want the symbols sorted by.  Click on the current sort title to unsort.


14-jan-1995
-----------
- WDB: Linux: Fixed a pb in `suspend' since WDB is a GPM client.  Was stuck
  after `fg'.

+ New GPU/DSP script called ngpu.db, using the new variable ctxtcpu.
  Mainly useful only with rdbjag.


13-jan-1995
-----------
+ When using "getsym" (and therefore "aread"), already existing symbols
  will not be created again.  This has been requested at least by Ubi Soft.

+ The GPU/DSP Data Organisation Registers are initialized before use of
  GPU/DSP.  This helps a lot!

! WARNING: The alternate register bank is not handled!


12-jan-1995
-----------
= DB and WDB for PC/DOS and PC/Linux are now compiled with GCC 2.6.3.

+ In command-line completion, symbols not found are searched again with a
  '_' appended to them.  Useful with GCC generated code!  So, in order to
  find those symbols easily, just type in the name WITHOUT '_' everywhere
  and, unless there is another symbol with this name, it will be recognised
  for what it is.


11-jan-1995
-----------
- WDB: Fixed a pb when duplicating a window: it has not gadgets!

- WDB: Fixed a pb with "x" command.  Was unsigned since 02-jan-1995.

+ Gasm and Dasm now take ccdef in upper case too.


09-jan-1995
-----------
+ Added ccr handling in DSP disassembly for JMP/JR.

= GPU and DSP context switching seems OK and handled everywhere.  Still to
  do: breakpoints.

= Removed old-style GPU disassembly.

! WARNING: the new GPU/DSP context management is using the same stub area
  for its code ($2000-$21ff).  So, you will not be able to use the script
  GPU.DB with DB versions after 02-jan-1995.


07-jan-1995
-----------
= Changed "stoP" command to "Halt", according to WDB change.

= WDB: Changed "stoP" entry in Context menu to "Halt".


06-jan-1995
-----------
+ GPU registers context switching now OK.

+ Changed rate display for time<1 sec.  Now displays the real time.
  Behaves strangely under MS/Windows !? Fixed on 27-mar-1995.


05-jan-1995
-----------
+ WDB: Added space bar for page down in Disassembly window.

+ Added ccr handling in GPU disassembly for JMP/JR.

+ Added ccr handling in M68K disassembly for JMP/JSR.


04-jan-1995
-----------
+ WDB: Allowed re-creating Console window, which does not create another window
  but really move/resize the existing one.  So, in wdb.rc, Console window is
  saved as the other windows, thus allowing customisation for its
  size/position.


02-jan-1995
-----------
+ WDB: Finished GPU context handling.  Waow, what a mess to do it!

+ WDB: Added a new window type: CPUs, which shows all CPUs activity.  (This
  window will be improved in the future).

+ WDB: Reworked a bit Breakpoints and Checkpoints windows.

+ WDB: Fixed a (minor) bug in Symbols window.

+ WDB: Removed unnecessary under-titles in array-style windows.

+ Almost finished GPU context handling.  Waow, what a mess to do it!

+ Added new variable: ctxtcpu, which contains the current cpu number
  handled by t, etc...  commands.  Default: 0 for M68K.  Still some problems
  in GPU registers context switching.  For that reason, it is not possible to
  set GPU registers from DB for the moment.


24-dec-1994
-----------
- WDB: Fixed a bug that reduced Console window command line to the size of the
  last Dialog Box command line after using it.

+ WDB: Added a Menu to Disassembly and Source window.

+ WDB: Reworked a bit other window specific menus.

- Removed "[y/N]" printing after yes/no questions.  Wish of Leonard Tramiel
  @ Atari Corporation.


23-dec-1994
-----------
= Changed lowercase hex output by the 'print' command to uppercase.  Wish
  of Leonard Tramiel @ Atari Corporation.


20-dec-1994
-----------
- Fixed a disassembly pb in MOVE PC,Rn.  It was (eventually) indicating
  EQURs related to R0 with dislab==0.  ORIGINAL.  Bug report by Leonard
  Tramiel @ Atari Corporation.


04-dec-1994
-----------
+ WDB: Changed Modules window.  It now displays N/A instead of `?' if the file
  is not available.  Also, module filenames are displayed first and the
  pathname after, since it is usually quicker and enough to see the filename
  only.

- WDB: Also fixed a bug that could occur when trying to load an ABS file with a
  non-existent first source file (was saying "read error" in the ABS file).

+ Command-line completion has been reworked a bit.  Mainly, you now get the
  program module filenames together with the program symbols for functions
  where it makes sense, and procedures and aliases where you want commands.

- The change made on 30-sep-1994 was sometimes not working.  It is now.
  Also, purging the module will make it searched again (until next error).
  To reflect that, mlist displays the line numbers if the module is already
  loaded and `N/A' if it was requested and doesn't appear to be available.


28-nov-1994
-----------
- WDB: Bug while determining if the contents of a dump window have to be
  refreshed after setting memory.

- WDB: Also, if a refresh was done, the window was also relocked.  This is
  fixed.  Same thing for disassembly window.

+ Added a new function: gasm <addr> <"opcode op0,op1">.  This assembles the
  given GPU assembly line into the given address.

+ Added a new function: dasm <addr> <"opcode op0,op1">.  This assembles the
  given DSP assembly line into the given address.

+ Added an interactive mode for gasm and dasm.  Simply typing:

		gasm <addr>
	or	dasm <addr>

  starts the interactive mode. 'q' to end.


26-nov-1994
-----------
+ WDB: Resizing is now also possible on the left of a window, by dragging the
  left border with the mouse (same as down and right borders).  Also, the
  upper left corner can be used for resizing.


25-nov-1994
-----------
+ WDB: The mouse is now blocked when trying to over-minimize or over-maximize a
  window.

+ WDB: Double-clicking on a window's title/move bar has the same effect as
  clicking on its fuller gadget.

+ WDB: Double-clicking on a iconified window uniconifies it.

+ WDB: An "autofocus" mouse behaviour is obtained by setting the `autofocus'
  internal variable to something != 0.


21-nov-1994
-----------
+ Added Home and End key handling in commandline editing (PageUp and
  PageDown have the same effect too).


20-nov-1994
-----------
+ WDB: Linux: WDB is now a gpm client (for the mouse).  You must have gpm v0.94
  or greater.

= Changed fast // code location from $3e00 to $2200.


2-nov-1994
----------
+ Added "suspend" command under Linux and reenabled it under Atari for
  MiNT.  If you want to suspend with ctrl-z, you must bind it.


31-oct-1994
----------------
+ WDB: Minor change: now if the debugger receive an event from the Jaguar while
  doing nothing, it handles that event.  You had to hit <return> in previous
  releases.  For instance, if you push the reset button, you'll now get the
  Stub message on the fly.


29-oct-1994
-----------
+ If the GPU/DSP disassembler finds that a "should be zero" 5-bit field is
  not zero, it prints ";!!" after the instruction.  I wish I could instead
  display a dc.w, but some people would, as usual, complain that an unwanted
  feature has been added.  That way is a kind of kludge but neutral.


19-oct-1994
-----------
- Fixed the previous fix of LEA/MOVEQ.


11-oct-1994
-----------
- Fixed a bug that can explain why the fast protocol didn't work on some
  (all ?) portable PC's.  Please report if it now works for you.

+ Handled REGEQUates defined with the new MADMAC syntax (bank 0/bank 1).
  They will be fully handled when the GPU will be totally managed from
  inside.


09-oct-1994:
-----------
= Emulated the side effect where 'x' resets the disassembly address to PC
  (like the good ole DB).


30-sep-1994
-----------
+ Changed behaviour in case of Source Not Found error.  It is only printed
  the first time.  Wish of Scott Sanders @ Atari Corporation.


28-sep-1994
-----------
= Removed 'faread'.  'Aread' follows 'pprot' as before.


25-sep-1994
-----------
= WDB: If the console window is topped after closing another one, the Windows
  Keyboard Control mode is automatically left.  Wish of Scott Sanders @
  Atari Corporation.


21-sep-1994
-----------
= Added function faread ('fast aread') which is controled by pprot.  AREAD
  IS ALWAYS SLOW.  pprot has no effect on it any more.  But, since it would
  too loosy to not change it, launching rdbjag with a command line will
  perform a "faread" function, unless pprot==-1.  Whish of Robert Dibley @
  Rebellion Software.

- Fixed a pb with the MORE in case of ctrl-c (it's really like the one
  under Linux :=)) under certain circumstances (like dir - more - ctrl-c -
  vars).  ( I told you to use the 'Q' key !  -Laurent- ) Thanks to Robert
  Dibley @ Rebellion Software.

+ Changed the '|' to tab (\t) in symbol display in console window.  Whish
  of Robert Dibley @ Rebellion Software.


09-sep-1994
-----------
+ WDB: Fixed a disappearing '\' on some pathnames when selecting a file in
   the Directory window.

- Fixed this spurious '\' that was appearing in command line completion of
  filenames.  Also changed the '/' to '\' under DOS/TOS.  All that is for
  cosmetic purposes, since something like /1\2//3\\\\4///myprog works anyway.

= Changed back some critical things by special request from Atari:

		moveq changed to moveq.l
		lea changed to lea.l
		scc changed to scc.b
		dbf changed to dbra
		move from or to usp changed to move.l

= Same for 'dislab' default value, which is now 0 (like the good ole DB).

= Added function 'fread' ('fast read') which is controled by 'pprot'.
  'READ' IS NOW ALWAYS SLOW.  pprot has no effect on it any more.


01-sep-1994
-----------
+ Inserted a delay between // port toggling.  This helps for some // cards
  (like some built-in in notebooks and the like) in fast // transfert.


30-aug-1994
-----------
+ Changed the fast // protocol on Atari/TOS to take "pprot" number of
  "out"s.  It seems that on a TT pprot should be 3 and on Falcon 030 4.  The
  0 value for pprot uses the full handshaked protocole as on PC/DOS.  The
  printed time and rate use the built-in clock instead of a timer as on
  PC/DOS, so they are precise on a 2 seconds gap.

  Q: Why not using a timer?

  A: Why is the parallel bus access not working in IPL<5?  Also fixed a pb
  with addq/subq value (probably came by 23-aug-1994).


23-aug-1994
-----------
+ Fast // protocol done on Atari/TOS too.  Pprot is only taken as <0 (old
  slow protocol) or >=0 (new fast protocol, with 3 fixed "out").


16-aug-1994
-----------
- Fixed a problem in fast // transfer when the block size is not a long
  multiple.  Thanks to Rob @ HMS Software.


10-aug-1994
-----------
+ Big improvement in parallel transfer protocol (brilliant idea, Tim!).
  The new protocol is used for uploading a file to the Jaguar, when a 'read'
  or an 'aread' function is used.  This is only for the PC/DOS version for
  the moment.

  A new variable called 'pprot' is added.  Its value may vary from -1 to 5,
  default value is 3.  This value is a time loop for the debugger to wait for
  the Jaguar to receive one byte.  So the faster your parallel board is, the
  higher this value must be set.  3 is the best value for the SIIG board, 2
  is the best value for an Everex MagicIO.

  If your card is a SIIG one, just leave this variable set to 3.  If you have
  any other card, you'll have to find out by yourself what value you have to
  assign to pprot: try to leave it set to 3.  If you get an error message
  during your next 'aread' or 'read' call, increase it's value.  If you get a
  speed < 100 Ko/s, try to decrease it's value (using the command 'x pprot
  <value>').  Once you'll know wich is the value for your card, just add a
  line in your RDB.RC file with the command 'x pprot <value>'.

  A value of 0 should work everywhere with a transfer speed of around
  120Ko/s.

  A value of -1 will reset the transfer protocol to the old slow one.  A
  transfer size < 8192 bytes will also use it automatically.

  This protocol has to be uploaded in the Jaguar RAM prior to be used, so it
  wont be used if you read a very short file.  It uses memory space from
  $3e00 to $4000, so do NOT try to read data into this space!  (Changed on
  20-nov-1994 to $2200 to $2400).

  ALSO: support has been added for software reset and stop.  This requires
  hardware changes to your Alpine board, please contact Atari Corporation if
  you don't have them.


24-jul-94
---------
  + Added a '#' in bclr/bset/btst display in GPU disassembly.


09-jul-1994
-----------
+ WDB: Version date added in Informations box.

+ WDB: Special (non-ASCII) characters used in window display are converted
  to ASCII equivalents for transcript. Also, line ends are now CRLF under
  Atari/TOS and PC/DOS, LF under PC/Linux.

= WDB: Section end address is now the address of the last byte used, not
  the first byte free.

+ WDB: *.* default selection in the Directory window changed to * for PC/DOS
  version.


28-may-1994
-----------
+ WDB: Top window now has red borders, while back ones have blue.

+ WDB: The "Informations" entry has been added, for Copyright informations.


22-may-1994
-----------
+ WDB: Switched "Open" and "Window" menu.  A window list is now displayed at
  the bottom of the "Window" menu.  If there are more than 10 windows, then
  the menu entry "Activate" is added to the menu bar, listing all the
  windows.

+ WDB: Added "Aread *.cof" menu option in "File" menu.


18-may-1994
-----------
+ WDB: Few minor cosmetic changes (Menu titles...).

+ WDB: Dir window automatically closes if called by Aread, Read or Load.


16-may-94
---------
- Fixed a bug in transcript that made it always append to an existing file.
  Nobody uses it?


15-may-1994
----------------
+ WDB: Load and Save WDB.RC.  It contains the windows configuration and is
  automatically loaded at start if found in current path or RDBRC.


13-may-1994
-----------
+ WDB: Script windows seem ok. Look at WINS.DB.


12-may-1994
-----------
+ WDB: Lock working for disassembly, memory dump and source level windows.

- WDB: windclose <#> now works properly.

= WDB: "windopen"-ing a script window now requires a procedure.


01-may-1994
-----------
+ WDB: Now works under MS-Windows.

- WDB: Alt_Gr is not activating menus any more.


19-apr-94
---------
+ Added a new variable: xenable which controls the x display after context
  switching.  Set to 1 if you want to have it.  Default is 1 in non-windowed
  version and 0 in windowed one (Wish from Robert Dibley @ Rebellion
  software).

+ Added a new variable: srclevel which controls the source level display.
  Set to 1 if you want to have it.  Default is 1.  (Wish from Robert Dibley @
  Rebellion software).

- Fixed one bug in GPU/DSP disassembly of STORE Rn,(R14/R15+n).  ORIGINAL.
  The label given was referencing 'n' and not 'Rn'!  (This was not happening
  in the new label display, of course...).  Thanks to Robert Dibley @
  Rebellion Software.

- Fixed a bug in getting line number for source level, i.e.
  <source>:<line> that happened when I added handling of a current line
  number per source.  It was always taking the last one instead of the new
  one.  Detected and reported by ...  guess who?


15-apr-94
---------
+ Added a new variable: dislab which controls the way labels are
  disassembled.  Set to 0 if you want old fashion (default is 1).


21-mar-94
---------
+ Added N_ASLINE source-level type symbol, so you must use MAC and ALN
  compiled at or after 21-mar-94 if you have ORG'ed GPU/DSP code and want to
  have source-level in it.

+ Fixed a bug in MOVEI's display of symbols (they were swapped).  ORIGINAL.

+ Fixed a bug in ADDQMOD's display (1st operand was displayed in decimal
  with a '$' sign!).  ORIGINAL.

+ Cosmetic changes in disassembly:

		values from 0 to 9 are displayed in decimal (so, without '$').
		moveq.l changed to moveq
		lea.l changed to lea
		scc.b changed to scc
		dbra changed to dbf
		move.l from or to usp changed to move

+ Fixed the way variable names were handled in command line/scripts: Debug
  symbols are still recognised, but they are scanned after all tries.  This
  is because it slowed down everything, and it is more consistent with
  scripts.  So now, globals/locals are scanned first, if it is not found then
  RDB tries to evaluate in hexadecimal, and if it doesn't succeed, it scans
  the debug symbols.  If it still not found, it prints <not a number or
  variable>.  That means, if your variable seems like an hexa number, you
  should prefix it with '.' (as before) otherwise it will be evaluated as a
  number.

+ Added the '-g' switch in command line that performs a go command after
  initialisation (should be used as: rdbjag -g myprog).  (wish from Rebellion
  Software).

+ Added (well, 10 minutes!) a skip command: 'z' skips next 68K instruction.
  (z <count> skips <count> instructions).

+ Added standard Motorola style CCDEFs in JR and JUMP disassembly.

+ Added the "disaddr" internal variable which contains the current
  disassembly start address.

- Fixed a bug in COFF input (was forgetting last symbol).



New features for 1.0
--------------------
- Now it should works under Windows, 386max and OS/2 VDM sessions (thanks
  to Sam Littlewood @ Argonaut).

- Fixed a bug in source level when more than one "aread" was called.

- Fixed a bug on Atari: "s" and "sw" were not working.

- Fixed a bug leading to hang when entering 'reload', 'unload' or 'xgoto'
  outside of a .db script (i.e when 'not loading').  ORIGINAL.

- Fixed a bug in 'unalias' function.  This was hanging before.  ORIGINAL.

+ Added a smarter 'more' everywhere it should be (I think).

+ Added a new ls usage: ls <fname>: (see before).

- Now RDBJAG swaps the message number under MSDOS (for autoexecute alias)
  (thanks to Glenn Williams @ Williams Brothers Development).

+ Added a smarter completion, context dependent.


New features for 0.99 ( next will be 0.99.1 :-) ):
--------------------------------------------------
+ Added variable handling in completion and function parameters.  Maybe too
  slow but quickly done (one line) and dumb (what if some label is to be
  called 'PC' ?).


New features for 0.98:
----------------------
- Fixed (again) a bug in inverse video handling on PC's (grin).

+ Added a new switch in command line option: -d will force rdbjag to use
  the parallel port specified with -p without test of parallel board.  Try it
  if your parallel board isn't recognized well enough.

+ Added the possibility to specify in the command line the name of a .ABS
  or .COF file to be 'aread'.  You now can enter 'rdbjag turtdemo.cof'
  directly.

- Fixed a bug causing the 'write' command to append to any existing file
  (thanks to John Carmack @ Id Software).

- Added three source level functions in rdbjag:

  1/ 'ls' will list the source code.  Usage is:

	  ls <addr> will list from <addr> (as before)
	  ls :<#> will list line number <#> in current source file
	    Ex: ls :218 will list line 218 of current module.
	  ls <fname>:<#> will list line number <#> in <fname> source file
	    Ex: ls main.s:420 will list line 420 of source file main.s.
	  ls <fname>: will list current line number in <fname> source file
	    Ex: ls main.s: will list current line of source file main.s.

  2/ 'mlist' prints a list of all source files loaded in memory.  Usage is:

	  mlist

  3/ 'mpurge' to unload source file(s) for small memory configurations.

	  Usage is:
	  mpurge <fname> will purge source file <fname> from memory.
	  mpurge * will purge all source files from memory.

!  In order to have the source level in your programs, you MUST use:

	  MADMAC with -fb -g
	  ALN with -e -g
	  (please see corresponding documentation for MADMAC and ALN).

+ Added the source level handling where it was useful (variables not yet
  handled: this will be 0.99):

		* after registers display (eg: 'x' but also 't', 'g' etc...).

		* the 'b' command recognizes the same syntax as 'ls'.

		* in breakpoints list.

+ Changed line number management according to new MADMAC's one (-1).


New features for 0.97:
----------------------
- Fixed a bug in 'sw' function, causing rdb to print a long in place of a
  word if the value was negative,

- Fixed a few bugs in the Atari version (thanks to Normen Kowalewski) : now
  rdbjag wont make an infinite loop when breaking (ctrlC) while in wait.
  Remember to make rdbjag.tos 'world readable' with prgflags if it hangs
  under MultiTos.

- Changed (again) the way rdbjag detects the Jag parallel port on PC's.
  Hope this will help.

- Changed the way rdbjag stops inverse video when reporting an error.  Now
  it uses ESC[0m.  Looks like ANSI.SYS doesnt understand the standard ESC[27m
  to stop inverse video.

- Fixed a bug causing <DEL> key to not work under DOS.


New features for 0.96:
----------------------
- Fixed a bug in symbols handling, now symbols should appear correctly if
  the file is loaded trough a filefix generated .SYM or a new aln generated
  .ABS with the aread function.

+ Added a command to load .ABS generated by the new ALN without the filefix
  step.  Try this 'aread' command and tell me if you like it.  It works with
  all .ABS, but the new ALN now defines symbols only once so rdbjag doesnt
  repeat a symbol multiple times.



27-dec-1993
-----------
- Fixed PC relative with negative offset disassembly.


New features for 0.94:
----------------------
= None.  Mainly a debug release.



New features for 0.93:
----------------------
= Cleanup of parallel board detection.  Basically the detection is:

  1/ Is there a parallel port ?  Try to put the port in standard mode and
  write a byte in it.  If we can read this byte after writing in I/O address,
  there is actually a board.

  2/ Is it bidirectionnal.  In this case after putting the port in input
  mode, we cant read no more what we wrote in it.

  The bug Atari corp detected was: if there is nothing plugged in the
  parallel DB25, then we always read the byte that was written in 1/.  Now we
  send another value for 2/.

  The exit(-1) encountered if no board was detected is now replaced with
  exit(0) to avoid go32 debug message when exiting.



New features for 0.92:
----------------------
+ TAB now completes the expression in input.  It tries to make an
  'intelligent' completion, i.e if getting the first word of a command, it
  will expand from the command table if it finds anything then from the
  variables table.  If it's the second word it tries variables first, then
  commands.  TAB TAB show all occurences found if more than one ('a la' gdb).

- Fixed a bug in creating files for transcript and save commands.

+ Added a very dumb 'more' for the help command.

- Fixed a bug in GPU MOVEI disassembly.  ORIGINAL.


New features for 0.91:
----------------------
+ Line editing and Prompt: New line editing with arrows, delete, scrolling
  and history.  A prompt now appears on each line .  'Db:' for standard
  input, 'Proc:' for procedure input and 'Set:' for setting values input.
  There is no history for the two last modes.  The history size is 100 lines
  for standard input.  Thus, no more key binding is allowed for : TAB,
  because we'll soon add an automated completion with it, BS, ^@ and ESC for
  line editing purposes.

+ Last command recall: When a single <cr> is entered while in standard
  input, the last command stored is executed again if it's logical (that is,
  for example, 'load' wont be stored, 'l' will be without parameters and
  'help' will be with parameters).
