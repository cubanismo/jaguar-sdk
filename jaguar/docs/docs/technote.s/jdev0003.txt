Re:   IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CDROM DEVELOPERS


The following is an addendum to the Jaguar CDROM Emulator Setup documentation
regarding connecting a Jaguar CD board Rev 3.4 to a Jaguar CDROM Emulation
System

The Rev 3.4 board has the Butch CD Controller Chip built in.  Furthermore,
the connector for the CDROM Emulation interface FALC2JAG is easily accessible
from the top side of the PCB.  The changes require all connected to be
switched off.  No additional cable connection between Jaguar base unit is
required (old Jaguar CDROM Emulator Setup document gets changed.  Leave out
step 4 and use the Jumper location information given in a) and b) for step 5)

a) Remove the nine Jumpers that enable the CDROM mechanism from jumper field
located next to the white rim of the CDROM mechanism (it is the only Jumper
field).  Don't lose the Jumpers.

b) connect the cable of the CDROM Emulation System Interface Adapter the
following way:

-----------------\
		  \	 --------- the FALC2JAG interface cable
		  !     /	   gets connected on the two longer
		  !    / Pin 1     rows of pins, marked with x.
		  ! x x o	   The coloured side of the cable 	
		  ! x x o	   needs to be connected to the
		  ! x x o	   connector side indicated as Pin 1
		  ! x x o 	   in this figure.
		  ! x x o
Drive 		  ! x x o
Mechanism	  ! x x o

To re-enable the CDROM drive mechanism switch all systems off, unplug the
FALC2JAG cable and replug the nine jumpers to their former locations (short
each x-o connection).
