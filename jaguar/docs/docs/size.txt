SIZE
----

SIZE is a utility that examines an executable program file or linkable object
module file and prints out information about the TEXT, DATA, and BSS segments
of the file (size, starting address, etc.)

Please note that some information is not appropriate for some files.  For
example, segments within a linkable object module do not have a start
address until they are linked together into a program file.

Usage: size [-s] [-sd] <filename>

       -s  =  Show symbols in file.  The symbols will be sorted alphabetically.
              The information shown is the symbol value, symbol name, and symbol
              type.  Symbols with the same name will be skipped (usually these are
              local labels which are used in different routines, or else special
              source-level debugging information symbols used by the debugger).

      -sd  =  Same as the -s flag, except that duplicate symbol names will
              not be skipped.

<filename> =  Name of file to be analyzed.  SIZE will first look for the
              filename and extension exactly as specified.  If no extension
	      is found, it will then try extensions of .COF and .ABS (in that
	      order).



Changes
-------

July 27, 1994
-------------
This is a completely new version of SIZE.  It now understands the following
file formats:

	DRI format executables (*.ABS)
	COFF encapsulated format executables (*.COF)
	DRI or BSD format object module files (*.O, *.OJ, *.OT)

This new version of SIZE replaces both the older version of SIZE and also
the NAME utility, because you can now also optionally display a list of
all the symbols defined within the file by using the "-s" switch on the
commandline.



May 13, 1994
------------

The SIZE utility now understands the BSD/COFF file format.  (Please note:
the Atari/TOS version of this tool was previously named SIZE68.)
