║                     GCC C compiler for Atari Jaguar                       ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Atari now makes available a Jaguar-specific version of the GCC C compiler.
It is hosted on a PC running MSDOS and can generate code for the Jaguar's
68000, GPU, or DSP.

The current release is based on GCC 2.6.3.

The information in this document is primarily an addendum to the main GCC
documentation covering just the concerns specific to the Jaguar version.
Most of the items in this document refer to GPU/DSP code generation, not
68000.  The main GCC documentation is included after the Jaguar-specific
portions at the beginning.


C++ Support
-----------
While GCC normally supports both C and C++, the current Jaguar release
supports only C.  The main reasons for this are:

* C++ programs tend to be quite large, due to the language's requirements for
dynamic runtime linking.  C++ programs commonly include significant amounts
of code which is never actually used at runtime (such as class methods that
may be overridden via inheritance or simply not used, but get linked in
because they are referenced by function pointer tables).  While this isn't
necessarily a major problem on a computer, where virtual memory schemes are
common and the code can be left on the disk until needed, it can cause major
difficulties on a console where ROM and RAM space is more limited.  Code
written in C, however, tends to be not very dramatically different in form or
size from what you would hand-code in assembly language.

* The GPU and DSP can only reliably execute code that resides in their local
RAM space, which is limited to 4k for the GPU and 8k for the DSP.  While
fairly structured at the high level, the thread of execution for C++ code at
runtime can be quite difficult to predict.  Support for the C++ features of
inheritance and virtual functions would require a highly integrated memory
overlay manager for the GPU & DSP, and this is not a trivial undertaking.



Installation
------------
Please read the entire section on installation before proceeding.

The archives that make up the distribution contain the directory information
necessary to put the files in the correct places relative to one another.
Extract each archive using the command line:

pkunzip -d {file}.zip

where {file} is the name of the archive file.  The entire directory hierarchy
is specified by the ZIP file, so you may need to be at the root directory of
your drive when you execute the command.

Note: If this is an update, you should first extract the archive contents
into an empty directory, back up your existing files, delete your existing
files, then copy over the new files.

You delete your existing files this way because some of them may no longer be
needed, and so there is nothing new in the archive to overwrite them.


Files & Directories
-------------------
The normal location for most files would be for the executables to go into
the JAGUAR\BIN directory and in subdirectories of this.  Note that due to the
requirements of GCC, some files _must_ reside in specific paths and should
not be moved.

The JAGUAR\BIN\AGPU directory contains files needed for Jaguar GPU/DSP code
generation.  The JAGUAR\BIN\M68K contains files needed for 68000 code
generation.  Note that there are some identical files in these directories.
Do not delete these files, as they are needed by GCC.  We have taken steps to
reduce the redundancy to the smallest possible amount, but we cannot
eliminate it completely without changing the basic operation of GCC.

The main files included in the various archives that make up the complete GCC
package are:

JAGUAR\BIN\GCC.EXE ----------- GCC compiler driver.  In most cases, you run
                               all of the GCC components through this
                               program.

JAGUAR\BIN\CPP.EXE ----------- GCC preprocessor

JAGUAR\BIN\MAC.EXE ----------- Madmac macro assembler, used to assemble code
                               created by GCC compiler

JAGUAR\BIN\AGPU\2.6\AS.EXE --- Stub program that calls Madmac.  You must use
                               a version of MADMAC dated March 31, 1995 or
                               later!

JAGUAR\BIN\AGPU\2.6\CC1.EXE -- GCC code generation module for Jaguar GPU/DSP

JAGUAR\BIN\AGPU\2.6\CPP.EXE -- Stub program that calls GCC preprocessor

JAGUAR\BIN\AGPU\2.6\SPECS ---- GCC configuration file

JAGUAR\BIN\M68K\2.6\AS.EXE --- Stub program that calls Madmac.  You must use
                               a version of MADMAC dated March 31, 1995 or
                               later!

JAGUAR\BIN\M68K\2.6\CC1.EXE -- GCC code generation module for Jaguar GPU/DSP

JAGUAR\BIN\M68K\2.6\CPP.EXE -- Stub program that calls GCC preprocessor

JAGUAR\BIN\M68K\2.6\SPECS ---- GCC configuration file

JAGUAR\LIB\*.* --------------- Miscellaneous object modules & archive
                               libraries (containing 68000 math support
                               routines)

JAGUAR\INCLUDE\*.H ----------- C language header files with Jaguar
                               definitions.  (included in SOURCE.ZIP)

JAGUAR\SOURCE\TEST_C --------- Simple C language source file for testing
                               proper compiler configuration.



Configuration
-------------
There are several DOS environment variables which must be set in order for
GCC to work correctly.  These can be set in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, via
another batch file, or directly from the MSDOS command line.

GCC_EXEC_PREFIX --- Set this to the path where the subdirectories containing
the compiler files are.  This would normally be "/jaguar/bin" in the default
setup supplied by Atari:

	set GCC_EXEC_PREFIX=/jaguar/bin/

Don't forget to include the trailing "/".

Additionally, the JAGUAR\BIN\AGPU\2.6\SPECS and JAGUAR\BIN\M68K\2.6\SPECS
files contain a reference to the location of the system include files.	You
may find it necessary to edit these files to reflect the correct path on your
system.  The lines look like this:

	*cpp:
	-I/jaguar/include

Change the part that reads "/jaguar/include" to the correct drive and path
for your system.  Please note that the GCC tools expect to use a forward
slash character as a directory separator, rather than a backslash ("/"
instead of "\").




Command Line Options
--------------------
The following command line options are available in addition to, or in some
cases instead of, the command line switches documented in the main GCC
documentation.  Note that some switches are GPU/DSP specific.


-mGPU		Selects GPU-only code generation. This is not really useful
                yet as the current version generates only instructions which
                work the same way on both the GPU and DSP.

-mDSP		Selects DSP-only code generation. This is not really useful
                yet as the current version generates only instructions which
                work the same way on both the GPU and DSP.

-mver=<vers>	Selects GPU or DSP version number (in decimal)
                (default version is 2)  This is not really useful yet.  It
                may be used in the future to distinquish between different
		versions of the Jaguar chipset.

-morg=<addr>	Sets the ORG addr (in hex) for the whole C file.  The default
		address is 0xf03000 for GPU, 0xf1b000 for DSP.  A value of 0
		cancels the ORG statement.

-msiz=<size>	Sets the code size (in hex) to check for.  The default is
                0x1000 for GPU, 0x2000 for DSP. A value of 0 cancels the
                test. (The compiler gives a warning if the total amount of
                code in a single module exceeds this amount.)

-mstk=<@>	Defines stack address.  Default is (ORG address + code
                section size specified with -msiz). A value of 0 cancels the
                stack setting.

-mstkinit	Enable GPU/DSP stack initialization in first function of
		module.

-mstkparm	Pass parameters through stack rather than registers.
		Normally, avoid using "-mstkparm", especially with
                GPU/DSP code, since the resulting code is really awful.

-mnoit		Assume there are no interrupts running. This saves r30.

-mdivun		Always reset the divide mode before DIV.

-mdiv16		Assume that divide mode is always 16-bit, so change it if 32.

-mdiv32		Assume that divide mode is always 32-bit, so change it if 16.

-mnoalt		Don't use the alternate bank registers for GPU/DSP code.

-mmathlib	Use GPU/DSP math support libraries linked at runtime instead
                of including them in generated code.

Notes:  You should always run GCC with: -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer to have
        optimal code.  Avoid using "-mstkparm" for GPU/DSP code since the
        stack-emulation required is large and slow.




Predefined Preprocessor Values
------------------------------
Some preprocessor macros are predefined.

Standard macros are:

	__GNUC__ contains GNU C's major revision # (2).

	__GNUC_MINOR__ contains GNU C's minor revision # (5 or 6).

	__OPTIMIZE__ is defined to 1 when passing -O1 or -O2.


With the standard SPECS files included, target macros are:

	JAGUAR, __JAGUAR and __JAGUAR__ contain 1.

	AGPU, __AGPU and __AGPU__ contain 1 when outputing GPU/DSP code.

	M68K, __M68K and __M68K__ contain 1 when outputing M68K code.

Note that previous versions of GCC for Jaguar (68000 code generation only)
predefined "__atariST__" and other things related to the Atari ST computers.
Please switch to using the "__JAGUAR__" define instead.


GPU/DSP Register Usage
----------------------
GCC follows these register usage rules by default:

-r0 to r5 are used as parameters. r0 is also function return register.

-r6 to r15 are local registers.

-r16 is reserved as a temporary register for GCC.

-r17 is the frame pointer (used as local with "-fomit-frame-pointer"

-r18 is the stack pointer. (default)

-r19 to r29 are global registers.

-r30 & r31 are unused except if "-mnoit" is specified then they are local.


You are able to alter those usages with the command line switches "-mnoit",
"-ffixed-REG", "-fcall-used-REG" and "-fcall-saved-REG".

The stack and frame pointers are not alterable. In order to be able to trash
registers in interrupts, one must use "-ffixed-r29" (for register r29).

GCC uses also the GPU/DSP alternate register bank, considered as local
registers, unless you specify the "-mnoalt" command line switch.
"-mnoalt" is strictly equivalent to "-ffixed-R0" until "-ffixed-R31".
It assumes that the register bank is not switched by external routines.

Registers are internally numbered as follow:

	00-31:	1st bank registers (r0-r31).
	32-63:	2nd bank registers (R0-R31).
	64:	Program Counter.



Startup code
------------
Each file is normally ORG'ed to the start of GPU or DSP internal RAM unless
you specify a different address with "-morg=<@>" or disable this behaviour
with "-morg=0".

Most C compilers rely on external startup code which executes first and then
calls "main()" but that doesn't necessarily apply to the Jaguar in the
normal way.  When you use the "-mstkinit" option, GCC assumes the first
function compiled in each module would be the "main()" function, regardless
of its actual name.  It adds a "movei" instruction at the top of the
function, which is used to set the program stack.  At the end of the first
function GCC adds "jr T,*" as return code.  These actions may be disabled by
using "-mstk=0" on the command line.

Future versions of GCC will also use the "-mstk=0" option to control register
saving/restoration in the first function.


Data types
----------
There is no floating point math support.  Only the basic data types 'char',
'short', 'int', and 'long' are allowed.  The 'long long' type is not allowed.
The 'unsigned' option may be used with any of these types.

The size of an 'int' is 32 bits.  The size of a 'long' is 32-bits.  The size
of a 'short' is 16-bits.  The size of a 'char' is 8 bits.

When compiling code for the GPU/DSP, there is no way in the current version
of GCC to specify if data is in external RAM or in GPU/DSP RAM.  This means
two things:

- Any 'char' or 'short' memory reference will be done with loadb, loadw,
  storeb, storew.  Since GPU/DSP RAM can only be accessed 32 bits at a time,
  it is assumed that these types are based somewhere in external memory.

- Code interleaving and other register timing considerations are not aware
  that there are two types of memory and assume that things are done in
  internal memory.

The new GCC version 2.6 understands machine-specific requirements using the
feature __attribute__((xxx)).  So a future version will be able to do
something like:

	__attribute__((ext_memory)) will tell it is external memory.

	__attribute__((int_memory)) will tell it is internal memory.

The default, if nothing is indicated, would be that things are contained in
GPU/DSP memory.  So in the meantime, you can write something like:

	#define	XMEM	/*will be __attribute__((ext_memory)) one day*/
	#define	IMEM	/*will be __attribute__((int_memory)) one day*/

and use those defines in your program like:

	extern	XMEM	short	my_xtab[256];
	static	IMEM	int	my_itab[256];



Code Segments
-------------
The output of a GPU/DSP module will contain only a TEXT segment, no DATA or
BSS.  This means that everything declared locally in the source file (not
external) will be allocated in the GPU/DSP internal RAM.  Make sure to
specify things for external RAM in separate (68K files) C source code or
Madmac source code.

In the same way, there are no COMMON variables in GPU/DSP code modules

For GPU/DSP code, local variables are allocated in registers, and on the
stack only if no more registers are available.  In the stack, all local
variables are stored as 32-bits, regardless of the type.  You *MUST* declare
all your local variables as 'int', otherwise GCC will try to zero-extend
variables with loadw/storew or loadb/storeb, which will not work as expected
in internal RAM.  Of course, you will sometimes need short operands (i.e.
for MUL), so in those cases you must explicitely cast the variable.  See the
section titled "Operations" below.

The same things apply to stacked function parameters.

If you really want to use more than 'int' types for locals or stacked
parameters, then you must set your stack in external RAM.  This can work, but
of course will reduce performance and increase the overall bus usage.

BTW, since only zero extension can be performed while loading or storing to
(external) memory, use unsigned types (char or short) whenever possible.
Otherwise, you will get 2/3 of unuseful code.


Operations
----------
Multiplying two 16 bit values to get a 32 bit result is done with MULT/IMULT.

Multiplying two 32-bit values to get a 32 bit result is not directly
implemented as an instruction is not implemented in the GPU, so it is done
with libraries.  So you should cast your operands if you want GCC to use
MULT/IMULT with your int's:

	int	a,b,c;
	c=(short)a*(short)b;

You should therefore use a #define if you have lots of multiplications.

Divide is done with DIV by default, regardless of the operand sizes.  A
specific value may be set with command line switches.  It is suggested
anyway that you stick to only one DIV mode, even if you switch it by hand
directly in your code.

Anyway, remember that DIV is unsigned, so casting may be interesting.


Code size
---------
The code size used by a module is checked using the Madmac assembler's FAIL
directive at the bottom of the code generated by GCC.  If the size of the
generated code exceeds the size of GPU (or DSP) RAM, then an error message
will be given.

If you don't want to bother with this, simply use "-msiz=0" and run your code
in external RAM.  It will be slower, of course, but will work (subject to
the normal restrictions for GPU/DSP code running in external RAM).


Pragmas
-------
There are no machine specific #pragmas for the moment.  They will be used in
future versions if there's no other way to do something.  The "-m????"
switches and "__attribute__((xxx))" declarations should be enough, and are
_really_ more "portable" than #pragma.  I mean, you cannot #define a #pragma,
but you can have machine specific makefiles and header files.

Of course, if your code is heavily Jaguar specific... that may not really
matter.


Weird things
------------
You may want to generate functions without prologue and epilogue code.  This
should be handled by declaring the function as 'volatile', but unfortunately
this only skips the epilogue and not the prologue.  It seems to be a weird
problem in GCC in general, and hopefully will be changed soon.  Anyway, we
may add a "-mnoprologue" switch.


Delays and interleaving
-----------------------
GCC tries to interleave all ALU instructions by sets of 2 and all MEM
instructions by sets of 3.

It also tries to use the jump delay. However, if the delay cannot be filled,
a NOP is inserted.


Integrating GPU code in 68K code
--------------------------------
Each GPU C file includes a special label of the form "_<filename>_start"
where <filename> is the name of the original source file.  This label is
defined in 68000 code space, so it will be resolved to a ROM address, not the
execution address for the code.  In the same way, there are also labels of
the form "_<filename>_end" pointing to the end of the code, and
"_<filename>_size" containing the size of the code.


PIC support
-----------
There is no PIC (Position Independent Code) support at the moment.


Things to do
------------
1) Handle GPU's scoreboard bugs.


** Things that will maybe be handled in future versions **
----------------------------------------------------------
1) Profiling support.

2) Hand-inlining mulsi/umulsi/divsi/udivsi (multiplication & division for
signed integers)

3) Interleaving hand-inlined code like umodsi

n) Define ADDQT/SUBT and ADDC/SUBC, then

n+1) Scc emulation with ADDC/SUBC (but the built-in is quite ok).

n+2) LOADP/STOREP support for DI and BLK (but only for GPU and XMEM!!).

o) Support for floating point constants in MADMAC, thus allowing float
   support for M68K version.

o+1) Support for read-only data section?

╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

This version of GCC does not properly handle overflow conditions when doing
comparisons of signed 32-bit values for GPU/DSP code.  If both numbers are
negative, some combinations of values will cause an overflow during the
comparison.  In these cases the comparison fails to work properly.
Fortunately, this doesn't happen unless you have fairly large negative
numbers.  We hope to have this fixed in the next version.

╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝


23-may-1995
-----------
  AGPU: Math libraries fixed, now have new signed 32-bit divide routine.
  Thanks to Adisak Pochanayon @ High Voltage.

  AGPU: Fixed a sometimes disappearing comparison which caused some 'if'
  statements to fail.  Reported by Chris Brunning.


23-may-1995
-----------
  AGPU: GPU/DSP math support routines that are needed are now appended to
  the source.  Use "-mmathlib" to get them via the standard link procedure.


09-may-1995
-----------
  ALL: Fixed a problem when GCC was outputing an empty string.


05-may-1995
-----------
  PC/DOS: Undo "cpp.exe" replacement made on 18-apr-1995 because people using
  DJGPP (e.g.  like me) cannot use both compilers at the same time.


04-may-1995
-----------
  PC/DOS: Recompiled GCC without '-m486' for 386 users.

  AGPU: Moved stack pointer from r31 to r18, and consider r31 as r30.
  Added -mstkinit to enable stack initialisation in first function.


18-apr-1995
-----------
  PC/DOS: Replaced "cpp.exe" in AGPU and M68K directories with one that
  searches CPP.EXE in the PATH and executes it instead.  You must then be
  sure that CPP.EXE is in your path.

  PC/DOS: GCC is not compiled with -fomit-frame-pointer since it crashes
  under DPMI.

  Removed 'include' and 'inc' directories from archive.  (The include files
  are distributed separately.)


31-mar-1995
-----------
  PC/DOS: GO32 release 1.12m3 is now used as DOS extender.  Was crashing
  under Windows NT and probably Windows 95.  Reported and fixed by Brian
  McGroarty @ High Voltage Software.


21-feb-1995
-----------
  AGPU: "bset" and "bclr" use added.

  AGPU: -mGPU switch added, which will allow generating code for GPU only,
  like -mDSP for the DSP.  Not used for the moment but will be one day.


20-feb-1995
-----------
  AGPU: Fixed (for the last time hopefully) the reverse branch pb.  It could
  happen in some very special cases that a cmp staid reversed instead of
  being reversed again because of the dbr pass.



16-feb-1995
-----------
  AGPU: Fixed pb in tstsi with le and leu.  Reported by Dan @ Rebellion.

  AGPU: Put _RTS macro instead of inlining it, allowing easier use in
  assembly code.  Derived from a report by Dan @ Rebellion.


14-feb-1995
-----------
  GPU: Test-and-set constant folding improved.


12-feb-1995
-----------
   AGPU: CCR inheritance active again. "btst" use added.

-----------
   AGPU: movsi/addsi/subsi optimised.


07-feb-1995
-----------
  AGPU: Optimized output of -32..-1 and 32..63 constants even in -O2!

  AGPU: Fixed an oops...  multiply was removed on 06-feb-1995!  Reported by
  Dan @ Rebellion.


06-feb-1995
-----------
  AGPU: Fixed umodsi3 (negative AGPU modulo pb).  Reported by Dan @
  Rebellion.

  AGPU: Added udivmodsi4, worthful since umodsi3 is now longer.

  AGPU: Fixed a break in loop jump optimisation, seems to a GCC pb (I turned
  around it, but I will post the pb).  Reported by Dan @ Rebellion.

  AGPU: Fixed a pb in CC generation.

  AGPU: Fixed getting command line stack size.

  AGPU: Changed all default library names to __axxxx because they conflict
  with M68K names.  Requested by Dan @ Rebellion.

-----------
  AGPU: Fixed output of MOVEQ;NOT.  Reported by Dan @ Rebellion.

01-feb-1995
-----------
  ALL: Changed .SKIP to .DCB.B.  Reported by Dan @ Rebellion.


27-jan-1995
-----------
  M68K: Fixed output of switch table.

  AGPU: Fixed recognition of first function.  Was broken when first function
  ended with a BARRIER.  Reported by Dan @ Rebellion.

  AGPU: Check if optimising before scanning insn_addresses.  Could cause a
  segmentation fault when no -O was specified.


20-jan-1995
-----------
  AGPU: Fixed typo in umodsi: move->store.  Reported by Jamie @ Rebellion.


15-jan-1995
-----------
  PC/DOS: Replaced "as.exe" in AGPU and M68K directories with one that
  searches MAC.EXE in the PATH and executes it instead.  You must then be
  sure that MAC.EXE is in your path.

GCC(1)                      GNU Tools                      GCC(1)

NAME
     gcc, g++ - GNU project C and C++ Compiler (v2 preliminary)

SYNOPSIS
     gcc [option | filename ]...
     g++ [option | filename ]...

WARNING
     The information in this man page is an extract from the full
     documentation  of  the GNU C compiler, and is limited to the
     meaning of the options.

     For complete, current documentation, refer to the Info  file
     `gcc'  or  the  manual Using and Porting GNU CC (for version
     2.0).   Both  are  made  from  the   Texinfo   source   file
     gcc.texinfo.

DESCRIPTION
     The C and C++ compilers are integrated.  Both process  input
     files  through  one  or  more of four stages: preprocessing,
     compilation, assembly, and linking.   Source  filename  suf-
     fixes  identify  the source language, but which name you use
     for the compiler governs default assumptions:

     gcc  assumes preprocessed (.i) files are  C  and  assumes  C
          style linking.

     g++  assumes preprocessed (.i) files are C++ and assumes C++
          style linking.

     Suffixes of source file names indicate the language and kind
     of processing to be done:

     .c     C source; preprocess, compile, assemble
     .C     C++ source; preprocess, compile, assemble
     .cc     C++ source; preprocess, compile, assemble
     .cxx     C++ source; preprocess, compile, assemble
     .m     Objective-C source; preprocess, compile, assemble
     .i     preprocessed C or C++; compile, assemble
     .s     Assembler source; assemble
     .S     Assembler source; preprocess, assemble
     .h     Preprocessor file; not usually named on command line

     ??     Other (unrecognized) files passed to linker.
          Common cases:
     .o     Object file
     .a     Archive file

     Linking is always the last stage unless you use one  of  the
     -c,  -S,  or  -E  options to avoid it (or unless compilation
     errors stop the whole process).  For the link stage, all  .o
     files   corresponding   to   source   files,  -l  libraries,
     unrecognized filenames (including named .o object files  and
     .a archives) are passed to the linker in command-line order.

OPTIONS
     Options must be separate: `-dr' is quite different from  `-d
     -r '.

     Most `-f' and `-W' options have two contrary  forms:  -fname
     and  -fno-name  (or  -Wname  and  -Wno-name).  Only the non-
     default forms are shown here.

OVERALL OPTIONS
     -x language
          Specify explicitly the language for the following input
          files (rather than choosing a default based on the file
          name suffix) .  This option applies  to  all  following
          input  files  until  the  next  `-x'  option.  Possible
          values of language are `c', `objective-c',  `c-header',
          `c++',       `cpp-output',       `assembler',       and
          `assembler-with-cpp'.

     -x none
          Turn off any specification of a language, so that  sub-
          sequent  files are handled according to their file name
          suffixes (as they are if `-x'  has  not  been  used  at
          all).

     If you want only some of the four stages  (preprocess,  com-
     pile,  assemble,  link),  you can use `-x' (or filename suf-
     fixes) to tell gcc where to start, and one  of  the  options
     `-c',  `-S', or `-E' to say where gcc is to stop.  Note that
     some combinations (for example, `-x cpp-output -E') instruct
     gcc to do nothing at all.

     -c   Compile or assemble the source files, but do not  link.
          The  compiler output is an object file corresponding to
          each source file.

          By default, GCC makes the object file name for a source
          file  by  replacing  the suffix `.c', `.i', `.s', etc.,
          with `.o'.  Use -o to select another name.

          GCC ignores any unrecognized input files (those that do
          not  require  compilation  or assembly) with the -c op-
          tion.

     -S   Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not  as-
          semble.   The output is an assembler code file for each
          non-assembler input file specified.

          By default, GCC makes the assembler  file  name  for  a
          source  file  by replacing the suffix `.c', `.i', etc.,
          with `.s'.  Use -o to select another name.

          GCC ignores any input files that don't require compila-
          tion.

     -E   Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the com-
          piler  proper.  The output is preprocessed source code,
          which is sent to the standard output.

          GCC ignores input files which don't require preprocess-
          ing.

     -o file
           Place output in file file.  This applies regardless to
          whatever sort of output GCC is producing, whether it be
          an executable file, an object file, an  assembler  file
          or preprocessed C code.

          Since only one output file can be  specified,  it  does
          not make sense to use `-o' when compiling more than one
          input file, unless you are producing an executable file
          as output.

          If you do not specify `-o', the default is  to  put  an
          executable   file  in  `a.out',  the  object  file  for
          `source.suffix' in `source.o', its  assembler  file  in
          `source.s',  and  all preprocessed C source on standard
          output.

     -v   Print (on standard error output) the commands  executed
          to  run the stages of compilation.  Also print the ver-
          sion number of the compiler driver program and  of  the
          preprocessor and the compiler proper.

     -vpath
          Print (on standard error output) all attempts at  find-
          ing files, tracing how the `-B', `-b', and `-V' options
          interact.  Also, print the commands executed to run the
          stages  of  compilation  and  version numbers, like the
          `-v' option.

     -vspec
          Print (on standard error output) all  spec's  processed
          by  the do_spec_1 function in `gcc.c'.  Also, print the
          commands executed to run the stages of compilation  and
          version numbers, like the `-v' option.

     -pipe
          Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication
          between  the various stages of compilation.  This fails
          to work on some systems where the assembler cannot read
          from a pipe; but the GNU assembler has no trouble.

LANGUAGE OPTIONS
     The following options control the dialect of C that the com-
     piler accepts:

     -ansi
          Support all ANSI standard C programs.

          This turns off certain features of GNU C that  are  in-
          compatible  with  ANSI  C,  such as the asm, inline and
          typeof keywords, and predefined macros such as unix and
          vax that identify the type of system you are using.  It
          also enables the undesirable and rarely used ANSI  tri-
          graph feature, and makes the preprocessor accept `$' as
          part of identifiers.

          The alternate keywords  __asm__,  __extension__,  __in-
          line__ and __typeof__ continue to work despite `-ansi'.
          You would not want to use them in an ANSI C program, of
          course,  but  it  is useful to put them in header files
          that  might  be  included  in  compilations  done  with
          `-ansi'.   Alternate predefined macros such as __unix__
          and  __vax__  are  also  available,  with  or   without
          `-ansi'.

          The `-ansi' option does not cause non-ANSI programs  to
          be rejected gratuitously.  For that, `-pedantic' is re-
          quired in addition to `-ansi'.

          The preprocessor  predefines  a  macro  __STRICT_ANSI__
          when you use the `-ansi' option.  Some header files may
          notice this macro and refrain  from  declaring  certain
          functions  or  defining  certain  macros  that the ANSI
          standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering
          with  any programs that might use these names for other
          things.

     -fno-asm
          Do not recognize asm, inline or typeof  as  a  keyword.
          These  words  may then be used as identifiers.  You can
          use  __asm__,  __inline__   and   __typeof__   instead.
          `-ansi' implies `-fno-asm'.

     -fno-builtin
          (Ignored for C++.) Don't  recognize  non-ANSI  built-in
          functions.   `-ansi'  also  has this effect. Currently,
          the only function affected is alloca.

     -fno-strict-prototype
          (C++ only.) Consider the declaration int foo  ();.   In
          C++,  this  means  that the function foo takes no argu-
          ments.  In ANSI C, this  is  declared  int  foo(void);.
          With  the flag `-fno-strict-prototype', declaring func-
          tions with no arguments is equivalent to declaring  its
          argument  list  to  be  untyped,  i.e.,  int foo (); is
          equivalent to saying int foo (...);.

     -trigraphs
          Support ANSI C trigraphs.  The `-ansi'  option  implies
          `-trigraphs'.

     -traditional
          Attempt to support some aspects of traditional  C  com-
          pilers.

          Specifically, for both C and C++ programs:

         In the preprocessor, comments  convert  to  nothing  at
          all,  rather  than to a space.  This allows traditional
          token concatenation.

         In the preprocessor,  macro  arguments  are  recognized
          within  string  constants  in  a  macro definition (and
          their values are stringified, though without additional
          quote  marks, when they appear in such a context).  The
          preprocessor always considers a string constant to  end
          at a newline.

         The preprocessor does not predefine the macro  __STDC__
          when     you     use    `-traditional',    but    still
          predefines__GNUC__ (since the GNU extensions  indicated
          by  __GNUC__  are  not affected by `-traditional').  If
          you need to write header files  that  work  differently
          depending on whether `-traditional' is in use, by test-
          ing both of these predefined macros you can distinguish
          four situations: GNU C, traditional GNU C, other ANSI C
          compilers, and other old C compilers.

         In the preprocessor, comments  convert  to  nothing  at
          all,  rather  than to a space.  This allows traditional
          token concatenation.

          within  string  constants  in  a  macro definition (and
          their values are stringified, though without additional
          quote  marks, when they appear in such a context).  The
          preprocessor always considers a string constant to  end
          at a newline.

         The preprocessor does not predefine the macro  __STDC__
          when     you     use    `-traditional',    but    still
          predefines__GNUC__ (since the GNU extensions  indicated
          by  __GNUC__  are  not affected by `-traditional').  If
          you need to write header files  that  work  differently
          depending on whether `-traditional' is in use, by test-
          ing both of these predefined macros you can distinguish
          four situations: GNU C, traditional GNU C, other ANSI C
          compilers, and other old C compilers.

         String ``constants'' are not necessarily constant; they
          are  stored  in  writable  space, and identical looking
          constants are allocated separately.  (This is the  same
          as the effect of `-fwritable-strings'.)

          In addition, `-traditional' has  these  effects  for  C
          programs (not C++):

         All extern declarations take effect  globally  even  if
          they are written inside of a function definition.  This
          includes implicit declarations of functions.

         The keywords typeof, inline, signed, const and volatile
          are not recognized.  (You can still use the alternative
          keywords such as __typeof__, __inline__, and so on.)

         Comparisons between pointers and  integers  are  always
          allowed.

         Integer types unsigned short and unsigned char  promote
          to unsigned int.

         Out-of-range floating point literals are not an error.

         All  automatic  variables  not  declared  register  are
          preserved  by  longjmp.  Ordinarily, GNU C follows ANSI
          C: automatic variables not  declared  volatile  may  be
          clobbered.

          Finally, for C++ programs only (not C),  `-traditional'
          has  one  additional effect: assignment to this is per-
          mitted.   This  is  the   same   as   the   effect   of
          `-fthis-is-variable'.

     -traditional-cpp
          Attempt  to  support  some  aspects  of  traditional  C
          preprocessors.   This  includes the items that specifi-
          cally mention the preprocessor above, but none  of  the
          other effects of `-traditional'.

     -fdollars-in-identifiers
          (C++ only.) Permit  the  use  of  `$'  in  identifiers.
          (For  GNU C, this is the default, and you can forbid it
          with `-ansi'.) Traditional C allowed the character  `$'
          to form part of identifiers; by default, GNU C also al-
          lows this.  However, ANSI C forbids `$' in identifiers,
          and  GNU  C++  also forbids it by default on most plat-
          forms (though on some platforms it's enabled by default
          for GNU C++ as well).

     -fenum-int-equiv
          (C++ only.) Normally GNU C++ allows conversion of  enum
          to  int, but not the other way around.  Use this option
          if you want GNU C++ to allow conversion of int to  enum
          as well.

     -fall-virtual
          (C++ only.)  When  you  use  the  `-fall-virtual',  all
          member  functions (except for constructor functions and
          new/delete member operators) declared in the same class
          with  a  ``method-call'' operator method are treated as
          virtual functions of the given class.  In  effect,  all
          of these methods become ``implicitly virtual.''

          This does not mean that all calls to these methods will
          be  made  through  the  internal table of virtual func-
          tions.  There are some circumstances under which it  is
          obvious  that a call to a given virtual function can be
          made directly, and in these cases the  calls  still  go
          direct.

          The effect of making all methods of a class with a  de-
          clared   `operator->()()'   implicitly   virtual  using
          `-fall-virtual' extends  also  to  all  non-constructor
          methods of any class derived from such a class.

     -fcond-mismatch
          Allow conditional expressions with mismatched types  in
          the  second  and third arguments.  The value of such an
          expression is void.

     -fthis-is-variable
          (C++ only.)  The  incorporation  of  user-defined  free
          store  management  into C++ has made assignment to this
          an anachronism.  Therefore, by default GNU  C++  treats
          the  type of this in a member function of class X to be
          X *const.  In other words, it is illegal to  assign  to
          this  within  a  class  member  function.  However, for
          backwards  compatibility,  you  can  invoke   the   old
          behavior by using `-fthis-is-variable'.

     -funsigned-char
          Let the type char be unsigned, like unsigned char.

          Each kind of machine has a default for what char should
          be.  It is either like unsigned char by default or like
          signed char by default.

          Ideally, a portable program should  always  use  signed
          char or unsigned char when it depends on the signedness
          of an object.  But many programs have been  written  to
          use plain char and expect it to be signed, or expect it
          to be unsigned, depending on  the  machines  they  were
          written  for.   This  option,  and its inverse, let you
          make such a program work with the opposite default.

          The type char is always a distinct type  from  each  of
          signed char and unsigned char, even though its behavior
          is always just like one of those two.

     -fsigned-char
          Let the type char be signed, like signed char.

          Note that this is equivalent  to  `-fno-unsigned-char',
          which is the negative form of `-funsigned-char'.  Like-
          wise,    `-fno-signed-char'    is     equivalent     to
          `-funsigned-char'.

     -fsigned-bitfields

     -funsigned-bitfields

     -fno-signed-bitfields

     -fno-unsigned-bitfields
          These options control whether a bitfield is  signed  or
          unsigned,  when  declared  with no explicit `signed' or
          `unsigned' qualifier.  By default, such a  bitfield  is
          signed,  because  this is consistent: the basic integer
          types such as int are signed types.

          However, when you specify `-traditional', bitfields are
          all unsigned no matter what.

     -fwritable-strings
          Store string constants in the writable data segment and
          don't  uniquize  them.   This is for compatibility with
          old programs which assume they can  write  into  string
          constants.  `-traditional' also has this effect.

	  Writing into string  constants  is  a  very  bad  idea;
          ``constants'' should be constant.

PREPROCESSOR OPTIONS
     These options control the C preprocessor, which  is  run  on
     each C source file before actual compilation.

     If you use the `-E' option, GCC does nothing except  prepro-
     cessing.   Some  of  these  options make sense only together
     with `-E' because they cause the preprocessor output  to  be
     unsuitable for actual compilation.

     -i file
           Process file as input, discarding the  resulting  out-
          put, before processing the regular input file.  Because
          the output generated from file is discarded,  the  only
          effect  of  `-i  file' is to make the macros defined in
          file available for use in the main input.  The  prepro-
          cessor  evaluates any `-D' and `-U' options on the com-
          mand line before processing `-i' file.

     -nostdinc
          Do not  search  the  standard  system  directories  for
          header  files.  Only the directories you have specified
          with `-I' options (and the current  directory,  if  ap-
          propriate) are searched.

          By using both `-nostdinc' and `-I-', you can limit  the
          include-file  search file to only those directories you
          specify explicitly.

     -undef
          Do not predefine any  nonstandard  macros.   (Including
          architecture flags).

     -E   Run only the C  preprocessor.   Preprocess  all  the  C
          source  files specified and output the results to stan-
          dard output or to the specified output file.

     -C   Tell the preprocessor not to  discard  comments.   Used
          with the `-E' option.

     -P   Tell the preprocessor not to generate `#line' commands.
          Used with the `-E' option.

     -M   Tell the preprocessor to output  a  rule  suitable  for
          make  describing  the dependencies of each object file.
          For each source  file,  the  preprocessor  outputs  one
          make-rule whose target is the object file name for that
          source file and whose dependencies are  all  the  files
          `#include'd  in  it.  This rule may be a single line or
          may be continued with `\'-newline if it is  long.   The
          list  of rules is printed on standard output instead of
          the preprocessed C program.

          `-M' implies `-E'.

     -MM  Like `-M' but the output mentions only the user  header
          files  included  with  `#include file"'.  System header
          files included with `#include <file>' are omitted.

     -MD  Like `-M' but the dependency information is written  to
          files  with  names  made by replacing `.c' with `.d' at
          the end of the input file names.  This is  in  addition
          to compiling the file as specified-`-MD' does not inhi-
          bit ordinary compilation the way `-M' does.

          The Mach utility `md' can be used  to  merge  the  `.d'
          files  into a single dependency file suitable for using
          with the `make' command.

     -MMD Like `-MD' except mention only user header  files,  not
          system header files.

     -H   Print the name of each header file used, in addition to
          other normal activities.

     -Dmacro
          Define macro macro with the string `1' as  its  defini-
          tion.

     -Dmacro=defn
          Define macro macro as defn.    All instances of `-D' on
          the  command line are processed before any `-U' or `-i'
          options.

     -Umacro
          Undefine macro macro.  `-U' options are evaluated after
          all `-D' options, but before any `-i' options.

     -dM  Tell the preprocessor to output only a list of the mac-
          ro definitions that are in effect at the end of prepro-
          cessing.  Used with the `-E' option.

     -dD  Tell the preprocessing to pass  all  macro  definitions
          into  the  output, in their proper sequence in the rest
          of the output.

     -dN  Like `-dD' except that the macro arguments and contents
          are  omitted.   Only  `#define name' is included in the
          output.

LINKER OPTIONS
     These options come into play when the compiler links  object
     files  into an executable output file.  They are meaningless
     if the compiler is not doing a link step.

     object-file-name
          A file name that does not end in a  special  recognized
          suffix is considered to name an object file or library.
          (Object files are distinguished from libraries  by  the
          linker  according to the file contents.)  If GCC does a
          link step, these object files are used as input to  the
          linker.

     -dynamic
          On systems that support dynamic linking,  you  can  use
          this option to request it explicitly.

     -llibrary
           Use the library named library when linking.

          The linker searches a standard list of directories  for
          the   library,   which   is   actually   a  file  named
          `liblibrary.a'.  The linker then uses this file  as  if
          it had been specified precisely by name.

          The directories searched include several standard  sys-
          tem directories plus any that you specify with `-L'.

          Normally the files found this way  are  library  files-
          archive  files  whose  members  are  object files.  The
          linker handles an archive file by scanning  through  it
          for  members which define symbols that have so far been
          referenced but not defined.   However,  if  the  linker
          finds  an  ordinary  object file rather than a library,
          the object file is linked in the  usual  fashion.   The
          only difference between using an `-l' option and speci-
          fying a file name is that `-l' surrounds  library  with
          `lib' and `.a' and searches several directories.

     -nostdlib
          Don't use the standard  system  libraries  and  startup
          files when linking.  Only the files you specify will be
          passed to the linker.

     -static
          On systems that support dynamic linking, this  prevents
          linking with the shared libraries.  (`-g' also has this
          effect.)  On other systems, this option has no effect.

DIRECTORY OPTIONS
     These options  specify  directories  to  search  for  header
     files, for libraries and for parts of the compiler:

     -Idir
           Append  directory  dir  to  the  list  of  directories
          searched for include files.

     -I-  Any directories you specify with  `-I'  options  before
          the  `-I-'  option  are  searched  only for the case of
          `#include "file"'; they are not searched for  `#include
          <file>'.

          If additional directories are specified with  `-I'  op-
          tions  after  the `-I-', these directories are searched
          for all `#include' directives.   (Ordinarily  all  `-I'
          directories are used this way.)

          In addition, the `-I-' option inhibits the use  of  the
          current  directory  (where  the current input file came
          from) as  the  first  search  directory  for  `#include
          "file"'.   There  is  no way to override this effect of
          `-I-'.  With `-I.' you can specify searching the direc-
          tory  which  was current when the compiler was invoked.
          That is not exactly the same as what  the  preprocessor
          does by default, but it is often satisfactory.

          `-I-' does not inhibit the use of the  standard  system
          directories  for header files.  Thus, `-I-' and `-nost-
          dinc' are independent.

     -Ldir
           Add directory dir to the list  of  directories  to  be
          searched for `-l'.

     -Bprefix
           This option specifies where to find  the  executables,
          libraries and data files of the compiler itself.

          The compiler driver program runs one  or  more  of  the
          subprograms `cpp', `cc1' (or, for C++, `cc1plus'), `as'
          and `ld'.  It tries prefix as a prefix for each program
          it    tries    to    run,   both   with   and   without
          `machine/version/'.

          For each subprogram to  be  run,  the  compiler  driver
          first  tries  the `-B' prefix, if any.  If that name is
          not found, or if `-B' was  not  specified,  the  driver
          tries  two standard prefixes, which are `/usr/lib/gcc/'
          and `/usr/local/lib/gcc/'.  If neither of those results
          in  a  file  name  that  is  found, the compiler driver
          searches for the unmodified  program  name,  using  the
          directories  specified in your `PATH' environment vari-
          able.

          The run-time support file `libgcc.a' is  also  searched
          for  using  the  `-B'  prefix, if needed.  If it is not
          found there, the two standard prefixes above are tried,
          and  that  is all.  The file is left out of the link if
          it is not found by those means.  Most of the  time,  on
          most machines, `libgcc.a' is not actually necessary.

          You can get a similar result from the environment vari-
          able  GCC_EXEC_PREFIX;  if  it is defined, its value is
          used as a prefix in the same way.  If both the `-B' op-
          tion  and the GCC_EXEC_PREFIX variable are present, the
          `-B' option is used first and the environment  variable
          value second.

WARNING OPTIONS
     Warnings are diagnostic messages that  report  constructions
     which  are  not  inherently erroneous but which are risky or
     suggest there may have been an error.

     These options control the amount and kinds of warnings  pro-
     duced by GNU CC:

     -fsyntax-only
          Check the code for syntax errors, but  don't  emit  any
          output.

     -w   Inhibit all warning messages.

     -pedantic
          Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ANSI standard
          C; reject all programs that use forbidden extensions.

          Valid ANSI standard C programs should compile  properly
          with or without this option (though a rare few will re-
          quire `-ansi').  However, without this option,  certain
          GNU extensions and traditional C features are supported
          as well.  With this option, they are  rejected.   There
          is  no  reason  to  use  this option; it exists only to
          satisfy pedants.

          `-pedantic' does not cause warning messages for use  of
          the  alternate  keywords whose names begin and end with
          `__'.  Pedantic warnings are also disabled in  the  ex-
          pression  that  follows  __extension__.   However, only
          system header files should use these escape routes; ap-
          plication programs should avoid them.

     -pedantic-errors
          Like `-pedantic', except that errors are produced rath-
          er than warnings.

     -Werror
          Treat warnings as errors; abort compilation  after  any
          warning.

     -W   Print extra warning messages for these events:

         A nonvolatile automatic variable might be changed by  a
          call  to  longjmp.  These warnings are possible only in
          optimizing compilation.

          The compiler sees only the calls to setjmp.  It  cannot
          know  where  longjmp  will be called; in fact, a signal
          handler could call it at any point in the code.   As  a
          result,  you  may  get  a warning even when there is in
          fact no problem  because  longjmp  cannot  in  fact  be
          called at the place which would cause a problem.

         A function can return either with or without  a  value.
          (Falling off the end of the function body is considered
          returning without a value.)  For example, this function
          would evoke such a warning:

          foo (a)
          {
            if (a > 0)
              return a;
          }

          Spurious warnings can occur because  GNU  CC  does  not
          realize  that  certain  functions  (including abort and
          longjmp) will never return.

         An expression-statement contains no side effects.

         An unsigned value is compared against zero with `>'  or
          `<='.

     -Wimplicit
          Warn whenever a function or parameter is implicitly de-
          clared.

     -Wreturn-type
          Warn whenever a function is defined with a  return-type
          that  defaults  to  int.   Also  warn  about any return
          statement with no  return-value  in  a  function  whose
          return-type is not void.

     -Wunused
          Warn whenever a local variable is unused aside from its
          declaration, whenever a function is declared static but
          never defined, and  whenever  a  statement  computes  a
          result that is explicitly not used.

     -Wswitch
          Warn whenever  a  switch  statement  has  an  index  of
          enumeral  type  and lacks a case for one or more of the
          named codes of that enumeration.  (The  presence  of  a
          default label prevents this warning.)  case labels out-
          side the enumeration range also provoke  warnings  when
          this option is used.

     -Wcomment
          Warn whenever a comment-start sequence `/*' appears  in
          a comment.

     -Wtrigraphs
          Warn if any trigraphs are  encountered  (assuming  they
          are enabled).

     -Waggregate-return
          Warn if any functions that return structures or  unions
          are defined or called.  (In languages where you can re-
          turn an array, this also elicits a warning.)

     -Wformat
          Check calls to printf and scanf,  etc.,  to  make  sure
          that  the  arguments supplied have types appropriate to
          the format string specified.

     -Wuninitialized
          An automatic variable is used without first being  ini-
          tialized.

          These warnings are possible only in optimizing compila-
          tion,  because  they require data flow information that
          is computed only when optimizing.  If you don't specify
          `-O', you simply won't get these warnings.

          These warnings occur only for variables that are candi-
          dates  for register allocation.  Therefore, they do not
          occur for a variable  that  is  declared  volatile,  or
          whose  address is taken, or whose size is other than 1,
          2, 4 or 8 bytes.  Also, they do not  occur  for  struc-
          tures,  unions  or arrays, even when they are in regis-
          ters.

          Note that there may be no warning about a variable that
          is  used  only  to compute a value that itself is never
          used, because such computations may be deleted by  data
          flow analysis before the warnings are printed.

          These warnings are made optional because GNU CC is  not
          smart  enough to see all the reasons why the code might
          be correct despite appearing to have an error.  Here is
          one example of how this can happen:

          {
            int x;
            switch (y)
              {
              case 1: x = 1;
                break;
              case 2: x = 4;
                break;
              case 3: x = 5;
              }
            foo (x);
          }

          If the value of y is always 1, 2 or 3, then x is always
          initialized,  but  GNU  CC  doesn't know this.  Here is
          another common case:

          {
            int save_y;
            if (change_y) save_y = y, y = new_y;
            ...
            if (change_y) y = save_y;
          }

          This has no bug because save_y is used only  if  it  is
          set.

          Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare as
          volatile all the functions you use that never return.

     -Wstrict-prototypes
          Warn if a  function  is  declared  or  defined  without
          specifying  the argument types.  (An old-style function
          definition is permitted without a warning  if  preceded
          by a declaration which specifies the argument types.)

     -Wmissing-prototypes
          Warn if a global function is defined without a previous
          prototype  declaration.  This warning is issued even if
          the definition itself provides a prototype.  The aim is
          to  detect global functions that fail to be declared in
          header files.

     -Wall
          All of the above `-W' options combined.  These are  all
          the  options  which  pertain to usage that we recommend
          avoiding and that we believe is easy to avoid, even  in
          conjunction with macros.

     The remaining `-W...' options are not implied by `-Wall' be-
     cause they warn about constructions that we consider reason-
     able to use, on occasion, in clean programs.

     -Wtraditional
          Warn about certain constructs that  behave  differently
          in traditional and ANSI C.

         Macro arguments occurring within  string  constants  in
          the macro body.  These would substitute the argument in
          traditional C, but are part of the constant in ANSI C.

         A function declared external in one block and then used
          after the end of the block.

         A switch statement has an operand of type long.

     -Wshadow
          Warn whenever a local variable  shadows  another  local
          variable.

     -Wid-clash-len
           Warn whenever two distinct identifiers  match  in  the
          first len characters.  This may help you prepare a pro-
          gram that will compile with  certain  obsolete,  brain-
          damaged compilers.

     -Wpointer-arith
          Warn about anything that depends on the ``size  of''  a
          function  type or of void.  GNU C assigns these types a
          size of 1, for convenience in calculations with void  *
          pointers and pointers to functions.

     -Wcast-qual
          Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a  type
          qualifier from the target type.  For example, warn if a
          const char * is cast to an ordinary char *.

     -Wcast-align
          Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the  required
          alignment  of  the  target  is increased.  For example,
          warn if a char * is cast to an int * on machines  where
          integers  can  only  be  accessed  at two- or four-byte
          boundaries.

     -Wwrite-strings
          Give string constants the type  const  char[length]  so
          that copying the address of one into a non-const char *
          pointer will get a warning.  These warnings  will  help
          you  find  at  compile  time code that can try to write
          into a string constant, but only if you have been  very
          careful  about  using  const in declarations and proto-
          types.  Otherwise, it will just be a nuisance; this  is
          why we did not make `-Wall' request these warnings.

     -Wconversion
          Warn if a prototype causes a type  conversion  that  is
          different  from  what would happen to the same argument
          in the absence of a prototype.  This  includes  conver-
          sions  of  fixed  point to floating and vice versa, and
          conversions changing the width or signedness of a fixed
          point argument except when the same as the default pro-
          motion.

     -Wenum-clash
          (C++ only.)  Warn  when  converting  between  different
          enumeration types.

     -Wno-parentheses
          Disable warnings that parentheses are suggested  around
          an expression.

     -Woverloaded-virtual
          (C++ only.) In a derived class, the definitions of vir-
          tual  functions must match the type signature of a vir-
          tual function declared in the base class.  Use this op-
          tion  to request warnings when a derived class declares
          a function that may be an erroneous attempt to define a
          virtual  function:  that  is, warn when a function with
          the same name as a virtual function in the base  class,
          but with a type signature that doesn't match any virtu-
          al functions from the base class.

DEBUGGING OPTIONS
     GNU CC has various special options that are used for  debug-
     ging either your program or GCC:

     -g   Produce debugging information in the operating system's
          native  format (for DBX or SDB or DWARF).  GDB also can
          work with this debugging information.  On most  systems
          that  use  DBX format, `-g' enables use of extra debug-
          ging information that only GDB can use; if you want  to
          control  for  certain whether to generate this informa-
          tion, use `-ggdb' or `-gdbx'.

          Unlike most other C compilers, GNU CC allows you to use
          `-g'  with `-O'.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code
          may occasionally produce surprising results: some vari-
          ables  you  declared may not exist at all; flow of con-
          trol may briefly move where you did not expect it; some
          statements  may  not  be  executed because they compute
          constant results or their values were already at  hand;
          some statements may execute in different places because
          they were moved out of loops.

          Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized out-
          put.  This makes it reasonable to use the optimizer for
          programs that might have bugs.

          The following options are useful when GNU CC is config-
          ured and compiled with the capability for more than one
          debugging format.

     -ggdb
          Produce debugging information in DBX format (if that is
          supported), including GDB extensions.

     -gdbx
          Produce debugging information in DBX format (if that is
          supported), without GDB extensions.

     -gsdb
          Produce debugging information in SDB format (if that is
          supported).

     -gdwarf
          Produce debugging information in DWARF format (if  that
          is supported).

     -glevel
     -ggdblevel
     -gdbxlevel
     -gsdblevel

     -gdwarflevel
          Request debugging information and  also  use  level  to
          specify how much information.  The default level is 2.

          Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making
          backtraces  in parts of the program that you don't plan
          to debug.  This includes descriptions of functions  and
          external  variables,  but  no  information  about local
          variables and no line numbers.

     -p   Generate extra code to write profile information  suit-
          able for the analysis program prof.

     -pg  Generate extra code to write profile information  suit-
          able for the analysis program gprof.

     -a   Generate extra code to write  profile  information  for
          basic  blocks,  which  will  record the number of times
          each basic block  is  executed.   This  data  could  be
          analyzed  by  a program like tcov.  Note, however, that
          the format of the data is not what tcov expects.  Even-
          tually  GNU  gprof  should  be extended to process this
          data.

     -dletters
           Says to make debugging  dumps  during  compilation  at
          times specified by letters.  This is used for debugging
          the compiler.  The file names for most of the dumps are
          made  by appending a word to the source file name (e.g.
          `foo.c.rtl' or `foo.c.jump').

     -dM  Dump all macro definitions, at the end  of  preprocess-
          ing, and write no output.

     -dN  Dump all macro names, at the end of preprocessing.

     -dD  Dump all macro definitions, at the end  of  preprocess-
          ing, in addition to normal output.

     -dy  Dump debugging information during parsing, to  standard
          error.

     -dr  Dump after RTL generation, to `file.rtl'.

     -dx  Just generate RTL for a function instead  of  compiling
          it.  Usually used with `r'.

     -dj  Dump after first jump optimization, to `file.jump'.

     -ds  Dump after CSE (including the  jump  optimization  that
          sometimes follows CSE), to `file.cse'.

     -dL  Dump after loop optimization, to `file.loop'.

     -dt  Dump after the second CSE pass (including the jump  op-
          timization that sometimes follows CSE), to `file.cse2'.

     -df  Dump after flow analysis, to `file.flow'.

     -dc  Dump after instruction combination, to `file.combine'.

     -dS  Dump after the first instruction  scheduling  pass,  to
          `file.sched'.

     -dl  Dump after local register allocation, to `file.lreg'.

     -dg  Dump after global register allocation, to `file.greg'.

     -dR  Dump after the second instruction scheduling  pass,  to
          `file.sched2'.

     -dJ  Dump after last jump optimization, to `file.jump2'.

     -dd  Dump after delayed branch scheduling, to `file.dbr'.

     -dk  Dump after  conversion  from  registers  to  stack,  to
          `file.stack'.

     -dm  Print statistics on memory usage, at  the  end  of  the
          run, to standard error.

     -dp  Annotate the assembler output with a comment indicating
          which pattern and alternative was used.

     -fpretend-float
          When running a cross-compiler, pretend that the  target
          machine uses the same floating point format as the host
          machine.  This causes incorrect output  of  the  actual
          floating constants, but the actual instruction sequence
          will probably be the same as GNU  CC  would  make  when
          running on the target machine.

     -save-temps
          Store the usual ``temporary'' intermediate  files  per-
          manently;  place them in the current directory and name
          them based on the source file.  Thus, compiling `foo.c'
          with `-c -save-temps' would produce files `foo.cpp' and
          `foo.s', as well as `foo.o'.

OPTIMIZATION OPTIONS
     These options control various sorts of optimizations:

     -O   Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes  somewhat  more
          time, and a lot more memory for a large function.

          Without `-O', the compiler's goal is to reduce the cost
          of  compilation  and  to make debugging produce the ex-
          pected results.  Statements  are  independent:  if  you
          stop  the program with a breakpoint between statements,
          you can then assign a new  value  to  any  variable  or
          change  the  program  counter to any other statement in
          the function and get exactly the results you would  ex-
          pect from the source code.

          Without `-O', only variables declared register are  al-
          located in registers.  The resulting compiled code is a
          little worse than produced by PCC without `-O'.

          With `-O', the compiler tries to reduce code  size  and
          execution time.

          When   you   specify   `-O',    `-fthread-jumps'    and
          `-fdelayed-branch'  are  turned  on.   On some machines
          other flags may also be turned on.

     -O2  Highly optimize.  As compared to `-O', this option will
          increase  both  compilation time and the performance of
          the generated code.

          All `-fflag'  options  that  control  optimization  are
          turned    on    when    you   specify   `-O2',   except
          `-funroll-loops' and `-funroll-all-loops'.

     Options of the  form  `-fflag'  specify  machine-independent
     flags.   Most  flags  have both positive and negative forms;
     the negative form of `-ffoo' would be `-fno-foo'.  The  fol-
     lowing list shows only one form-the one which is not the de-
     fault.  You can figure out the other form by either removing
     `no-' or adding it.

     -ffloat-store
          Do not store floating  point  variables  in  registers.
          This  prevents undesirable excess precision on machines
          such as the 68000 where the floating registers (of  the
          68881) keep more precision than a double is supposed to
          have.

          For most programs, the excess precision does only good,
          but  a  few  programs rely on the precise definition of
          IEEE floating point.  Use `-ffloat-store' for such pro-
          grams.

     -fmemoize-lookups

     -fsave-memoized
          (C++ only.) These flags are used to get the compiler to
          compile programs faster using heuristics.  They are not
          on by default since they are only effective about  half
          the  time.  The other half of the time programs compile
          more slowly (and take more memory).

          The first time the compiler must  build  a  call  to  a
          member  function  (or  reference  to a data member), it
          must (1) determine whether the class implements  member
          functions  of that name; (2) resolve which member func-
          tion to call (which involves figuring out what sorts of
          type  conversions  need  to be made); and (3) check the
          visibility of the member function to the  caller.   All
          of  this  adds up to slower compilation.  Normally, the
          second time a call is made to that member function  (or
          reference  to that data member), it must go through the
          same lengthy process again.  This means that code  like
          this

            cout << "This " << p << " has " << n << " legs.\n";

          makes six passes through all three steps.  By  using  a
          software  cache,  a  ``hit'' significantly reduces this
          cost.  Unfortunately, using the cache introduces anoth-
          er  layer  of mechanisms which must be implemented, and
          so incurs its own  overhead.   `-fmemoize-lookups'  en-
          ables the software cache.

          Because access privileges (visibility) to  members  and
          member  functions  may differ from one function context
          to the next, g++ may need to flush the cache. With  the
          `-fmemoize-lookups'  flag,  the  cache is flushed after
          every function that is compiled.  The `-fsave-memoized'
          flag enables the same software cache, but when the com-
          piler determines that the context of the last  function
          compiled  would yield the same access privileges of the
          next function to compile, it preserves the cache.  This
          is most helpful when defining many member functions for
          the same class: with the exception of member  functions
          which  are  friends of other classes, each member func-
          tion has exactly the same access  privileges  as  every
          other, and the cache need not be flushed.

     -fno-default-inline
          (C++  only.)  If  `-fdefault-inline'  is  enabled  then
          member  functions  defined  inside class scope are com-
          piled inline by default; i.e., you don't  need  to  add
          `inline'  in front of the member function name.  By po-
          pular demand, this option is now the default.  To  keep
          GNU  C++  from inlining these member functions, specify
          `-fno-default-inline'.

     -fno-defer-pop
          Always pop the arguments to each function call as  soon
          as  that function returns.  For machines which must pop
          arguments after a function call, the compiler  normally
          lets  arguments  accumulate  on  the  stack for several
          function calls and pops them all at once.

     -fforce-mem
          Force memory operands to be copied into  registers  be-
          fore doing arithmetic on them.  This may produce better
          code by making all memory references  potential  common
          subexpressions.   When  they  are not common subexpres-
          sions, instruction  combination  should  eliminate  the
          separate  register-load.   I  am  interested in hearing
          about the difference this makes.

     -fforce-addr
          Force memory address constants to be copied into regis-
          ters before doing arithmetic on them.  This may produce
          better code just as `-fforce-mem' may.  I am interested
          in hearing about the difference this makes.

     -fomit-frame-pointer
          Don't keep the frame pointer in a  register  for  func-
          tions  that  don't  need one.  This avoids the instruc-
          tions to save, set up and restore  frame  pointers;  it
          also  makes  an  extra register available in many func-
          tions.  It also  makes  debugging  impossible  on  most
          machines.

          On some machines, such as the Vax, this flag has no ef-
          fect,  because  the standard calling sequence automati-
          cally handles the frame pointer and nothing is saved by
          pretending  it  doesn't exist.  The machine-description
          macro FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED controls whether a  target
          machine supports this flag.

     -finline
          Pay attention the inline keyword.  Normally  the  nega-
          tion  of  this option `-fno-inline' is used to keep the
          compiler from expanding any functions inline.  However,
          the  opposite  effect  may  be desirable when compiling
          with `-g', since `-g' normally  turns  off  all  inline
          function expansion.

     -finline-functions
          Integrate all simple functions into their callers.  The
          compiler heuristically decides which functions are sim-
          ple enough to be worth integrating in this way.

          If all calls to a given function  are  integrated,  and
          the function is declared static, then GCC normally does
          not output the function as assembler code  in  its  own
          right.

     -fcaller-saves
          Enable values to be allocated in registers that will be
          clobbered by function calls, by emitting extra instruc-
          tions to save and restore  the  registers  around  such
          calls.   Such  allocation is done only when it seems to
          result in better code than would otherwise be produced.

          This option is enabled by default on certain  machines,
          usually those which have no call-preserved registers to
          use instead.

     -fkeep-inline-functions
          Even if all calls to a given function  are  integrated,
          and  the function is declared static, nevertheless out-
          put a separate run-time callable version of  the  func-
          tion.

     -fno-function-cse
          Do not put function addresses in registers;  make  each
          instruction  that calls a constant function contain the
          function's address explicitly.

          This option results in less efficient  code,  but  some
          strange  hacks  that  alter the assembler output may be
          confused by the optimizations performed when  this  op-
          tion is not used.

     The following options control specific  optimizations.   The
     `-O2'  option  turns  on  all  of these optimizations except
     `-funroll-loops' and `-funroll-all-loops'.

     The `-O' option usually turns on  the  `-fthread-jumps'  and
     `-fdelayed-branch' options, but specific machines may change
     the default optimizations.

     You can use the following  flags  in  the  rare  cases  when
     ``fine-tuning'' of optimizations to be performed is desired.

     -fstrength-reduce
          Perform the optimizations of  loop  strength  reduction
          and elimination of iteration variables.

     -fthread-jumps
          Perform optimizations where we check to see if  a  jump
          branches  to  a  location where another comparison sub-
          sumed by the first is found.  If so, the  first  branch
          is  redirected  to either the destination of the second
          branch or a point immediately following  it,  depending
          on whether the condition is known to be true or false.

     -funroll-loops
          Perform the optimization of loop  unrolling.   This  is
          only  done  for loops whose number of iterations can be
          determined at compile time or run time.

     -funroll-all-loops
          Perform the optimization of loop  unrolling.   This  is
          done  for  all  loops.  This usually makes programs run
          more slowly.

     -fcse-follow-jumps
          In common subexpression elimination, scan through  jump
          instructions in certain cases.  This is not as powerful
          as completely global CSE, but not as slow either.

     -frerun-cse-after-loop
          Re-run common subexpression elimination after loop  op-
          timizations has been performed.

     -felide-constructors
          (C++ only.) Use this option to instruct the compiler to
          be  smarter  about  when  it  can  elide  constructors.
          Without this flag, GNU C++ and cfront both generate ef-
          fectively the same code for:

          A foo ();
          A x (foo ());   // x initialized by `foo ()', no ctor called
          A y = foo ();   // call to `foo ()' heads to temporary,
                          // y is initialized from the temporary.

          Note the difference!  With this flag, GNU C++  initial-
          izes `y' directly from the call to foo () without going
          through a temporary.

     -fexpensive-optimizations
          Perform a number of minor optimizations that are  rela-
          tively expensive.

     -fdelayed-branch
          If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder
          instructions  to  exploit  instruction  slots available
          after delayed branch instructions.

     -fschedule-insns
          If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder
          instructions  to  eliminate execution stalls due to re-
          quired data being  unavailable.   This  helps  machines
          that  have  slow floating point or memory load instruc-
          tions by allowing other instructions to be issued until
          the result of the load or floating point instruction is
          required.

     -fschedule-insns2
          Similar to `-fschedule-insns', but  requests  an  addi-
          tional  pass  of  instruction scheduling after register
          allocation has been done.  This is especially useful on
          machines  with  a  relatively small number of registers
          and where memory load instructions take more  than  one
          cycle.

TARGET OPTIONS
     By default, GNU CC  compiles  code  for  the  same  type  of
     machine  that  you  are  using.  However, it can also be in-
     stalled as a cross-compiler, to compile for some other  type
     of  machine.   In  fact, several different configurations of
     GNU CC, for different target machines, can be installed side
     by  side.   Then  you specify which one to use with the `-b'
     option.

     In addition, older and newer versions of GNU CC can  be  in-
     stalled  side  by  side.   One of them (probably the newest)
     will be the default, but  you  may  sometimes  wish  to  use
     another.

     -b machine
           The argument machine specifies the target machine  for
          compilation.   This  is  useful when you have installed
          GNU CC as a cross-compiler.

          The value to use for machine is the same as was  speci-
          fied  as  the machine type when configuring GNU CC as a
          cross-compiler.  For example, if a  cross-compiler  was
          configured  with  `configure i386v', meaning to compile
          for an 80386 running System V, then you  would  specify
          `-b i386v' to run that cross compiler.

          When you do not specify `-b', it normally means to com-
          pile for the same type of machine that you are using.

     -V version
           The argument version specifies which version of GNU CC
          to  run.  This is useful when multiple versions are in-
          stalled.  For example, version might be `2.0',  meaning
          to run GNU CC version 2.0.

          The default version, when you do not specify  `-V',  is
          controlled  by  the way GNU CC is installed.  Normally,
          it will be a version that is  recommended  for  general
          use.

MACHINE DEPENDENT OPTIONS
     Each of the target machine types can have  its  own  special
     options,   starting  with  `-m',  to  choose  among  various
     hardware models  or  configurations-for  example,  68010  vs
     68020,  floating  coprocessor  or  none.  A single installed
     version of the compiler can compile for any model or  confi-
     guration, according to the options specified.

     These are the `-m' options defined for the 68000 series:

     -m68020

     -mc68020
          Generate output for a  68020  (rather  than  a  68000).
          This is the default if you use the unmodified sources.

     -m68000

     -mc68000
          Generate output for a 68000 (rather than a 68020).

     -m68881
          Generate  output  containing  68881  instructions   for
          floating point.  This is the default if you use the un-
          modified sources.

     -mfpa
          Generate output containing  Sun  FPA  instructions  for
          floating point.

     -msoft-float
          Generate output containing library calls  for  floating
          point.   WARNING:  the requisite libraries are not part
          of GNU CC.  Normally the facilities  of  the  machine's
          usual  C  compiler  are  used,  but  this can't be done
          directly in cross-compilation.  You must make your  own
          arrangements  to provide suitable library functions for
          cross-compilation.

     -mshort
          Consider type int to be 16 bits wide, like short int.

     -mnobitfield
          Do not use the bit-field instructions.   `-m68000'  im-
          plies `-mnobitfield'.

     -mbitfield
          Do use the bit-field instructions.   `-m68020'  implies
          `-mbitfield'.  This is the default if you use the unmo-
          dified sources.

     -mrtd
          Use a different function-calling convention,  in  which
          functions  that take a fixed number of arguments return
          with the rtd instruction, which  pops  their  arguments
          while  returning.   This  saves  one instruction in the
          caller since there is no  need  to  pop  the  arguments
          there.

          This calling convention is incompatible  with  the  one
          normally used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need
          to call libraries compiled with the Unix compiler.

          Also, you must  provide  function  prototypes  for  all
          functions  that take variable numbers of arguments (in-
          cluding printf); otherwise incorrect code will be  gen-
          erated for calls to those functions.

          In addition, seriously incorrect code  will  result  if
          you  call a function with too many arguments.  (Normal-
          ly, extra arguments are harmlessly ignored.)

          The rtd instruction is supported by the 68010 and 68020
          processors, but not by the 68000.

     These `-m' options are defined for the Vax:

     -munix
          Do not output certain jump instructions (aobleq and  so
          on)  that  the Unix assembler for the Vax cannot handle
          across long ranges.

     -mgnu
          Do output those jump instructions,  on  the  assumption
          that you will assemble with the GNU assembler.

     -mg  Output code for g-format floating point numbers instead
          of d-format.

     These `-m' switches are supported on the Sparc:

     -mfpu
          Generate output containing floating point instructions.
          This is the default if you use the unmodified sources.

     -mno-epilogue
          Generate separate return instructions for return state-
          ments.   This  has both advantages and disadvantages; I
          don't recall what they are.

     These `-m' options are defined for the Convex:

     -mc1 Generate output for a C1.  This is the default when the
          compiler is configured for a C1.

     -mc2 Generate output for a C2.  This is the default when the
          compiler is configured for a C2.

     -margcount
          Generate code which puts an argument count in the  word
          preceding  each argument list.  Some nonportable Convex
          and Vax programs need this word.  (Debuggers don't, ex-
          cept for functions with variable-length argument lists;
          this info is in the symbol table.)

     -mnoargcount
          Omit the argument count word.  This is the  default  if
          you use the unmodified sources.

     These `-m' options are defined for the AMD Am29000:

     -mdw Generate code that assumes the DW  bit  is  set,  i.e.,
          that byte and halfword operations are directly support-
          ed by the hardware.  This is the default.

     -mnodw
          Generate code that assumes the DW bit is not set.

     -mbw Generate code that assumes the system supports byte and
          halfword write operations.  This is the default.

     -mnbw
          Generate code that assumes the systems does not support
          byte  and  halfword  write  operations.   This  implies
          `-mnodw'.

     -msmall
          Use a small memory model that assumes that all function
          addresses  are either within a single 256 KB segment or
          at an absolute address of less than 256K.  This  allows
          the  call  instruction  to  be used instead of a const,
          consth, calli sequence.

     -mlarge
          Do not assume that the call instruction  can  be  used;
          this is the default.

     -m29050
          Generate code for the Am29050.

     -m29000
          Generate code for the Am29000.  This is the default.

     -mkernel-registers
          Generate references to registers gr64-gr95  instead  of
          gr96-gr127.   This  option  can  be used when compiling
          kernel code that wants a set of global  registers  dis-
          joint from that used by user-mode code.

          Note that when this option is used, register  names  in
          `-f' flags must use the normal, user-mode, names.

     -muser-registers
          Use the normal set  of  global  registers,  gr96-gr127.
          This is the default.

     -mstack-check
          Insert a call to __msp_check after each  stack  adjust-
          ment.  This is often used for kernel code.

     These `-m' options are defined for  Motorola  88K  architec-
     tures:

     -mbig-pic
          Emit position-independent code,  suitable  for  dynamic
          linking,  even  if  branches  need large displacements.
          Equivalent to  the  general-use  option  `-fPIC'.   The
          general-use  option  `-fpic',  by  contrast, only emits
          valid 88k code if all branches involve small  displace-
          ments.  GCC  does not emit position-independent code by
          default.

     -midentify-revision
          Include an ident  directive  in  the  assembler  output
          recording  the source file name, compiler name and ver-
          sion, timestamp, and compilation flags used.

     -mno-underscores
          In assembler output, emit symbol names  without  adding
          an  underscore character at the beginning of each name.
          The default is to use an underscore as prefix  on  each
          name.

     -mno-check-zero-division

     -mcheck-zero-division
          Early models of the 88K architecture had problems  with
          division  by  zero;  in particular, many of them didn't
          trap.  Use these options to avoid including (or to  in-
          clude explicitly) additional code to detect division by
          zero and signal an exception.  All  GCC  configurations
          for the 88K use `-mcheck-zero-division' by default.

     -mocs-debug-info

     -mno-ocs-debug-info
          Include  (or  omit)  additional  debugging  information
          (about registers used in each stack frame) as specified
          in the 88Open Object Compatibility  Standard,  ``OCS''.
          This  extra  information is not needed by GDB.  The de-
          fault for DG/UX, SVr4, and Delta 88 SVr3.2  is  to  in-
          clude  this  information; other 88k configurations omit
          this information by default.

     -mocs-frame-position

     -mno-ocs-frame-position
          Force (or do not require) register values to be  stored
          in  a particular place in stack frames, as specified in
          OCS.  The DG/UX, Delta88 SVr3.2, and BCS configurations
          use  `-mocs-frame-position';  other  88k configurations
          have the default `-mno-ocs-frame-position'.

     -moptimize-arg-area

     -mno-optimize-arg-area
          Control  how  to  store  function  arguments  in  stack
          frames.   `-moptimize-arg-area'  saves  space,  but may
          break       some       debuggers       (not       GDB).
          `-mno-optimize-arg-area'  conforms better to standards.
          By default GCC does not optimize the argument area.

     -mshort-data-num
           num Generate smaller data references  by  making  them
          relative  to  r0,  which allows loading a value using a
          single instruction (rather than the  usual  two).   You
          control  which data references are affected by specify-
          ing num with this option.  For example, if you  specify
          `-mshort-data-512',  then  the data references affected
          are those involving  displacements  of  less  than  512
          bytes.   `-mshort-data-num'  is  not  effective for num
          greater than 64K.

     -msvr4

     -msvr3
          Turn on (`-msvr4') or off  (`-msvr3')  compiler  exten-
          sions  related to System V release 4 (SVr4).  This con-
          trols the following:

         Which variant of the assembler syntax  to  emit  (which
          you can select independently using `-mversion03.00').

         `-msvr4' makes the C  preprocessor  recognize  `#pragma
          weak'

         `-msvr4' makes GCC issue additional declaration  direc-
          tives used in SVr4.

     `-msvr3' is the default for all m88K  configurations  except
     the SVr4 configuration.

     -mtrap-large-shift

     -mhandle-large-shift
          Include code to detect bit-shifts of more than 31 bits;
          respectively,  trap  such shifts or emit code to handle
          them properly.  By default GCC makes no special  provi-
          sion for large bit shifts.

     -muse-div-instruction
          Very early models of the 88K architecture didn't have a
          divide  instruction,  so GCC avoids that instruction by
          default.  Use this option to specify that it's safe  to
          use the divide instruction.

     -mversion-03.00
          Use alternative assembler syntax for the assembler ver-
          sion  corresponding  to  SVr4, but without enabling the
          other features triggered by `-svr4'.  This  is  implied
          by  `-svr4',  is the default for the SVr4 configuration
          of GCC, and is permitted  by  the  DG/UX  configuration
          only if `-svr4' is also specified.  The Delta 88 SVr3.2
          configuration ignores this option.

     -mwarn-passed-structs
          Warn when a function passes a struct as an argument  or
          result.   Structure-passing  conventions  have  changed
          during the evolution of the C language, and  are  often
          the  source  of  portability problems.  By default, GCC
          issues no such warning.

     These options are defined for the IBM RS6000:

     -mfp-in-toc

     -mno-fp-in-toc
          Control whether or not floating-point constants  go  in
          the  Table  of  Contents  (TOC),  a table of all global
          variable and function addresses.  By default  GCC  puts
          floating-point  constants  there; if the TOC overflows,
          `-mno-fp-in-toc' will reduce the size of the TOC, which
          may avoid the overflow.

     These `-m' options are defined for the IBM RT PC:

     -min-line-mul
          Use an in-line code sequence  for  integer  multiplies.
          This is the default.

     -mcall-lib-mul
          Call lmul$$ for integer multiples.

     -mfull-fp-blocks
          Generate full-size floating point data blocks,  includ-
          ing  the minimum amount of scratch space recommended by
          IBM.  This is the default.

     -mminimum-fp-blocks
          Do not include extra scratch space  in  floating  point
          data  blocks.  This results in smaller code, but slower
          execution, since scratch space must be allocated dynam-
          ically.

     -mfp-arg-in-fpregs
          Use a calling sequence incompatible with the  IBM  cal-
          ling  convention  in which floating point arguments are
          passed  in  floating  point   registers.    Note   that
          varargs.h  and  stdargs.h  will  not work with floating
          point operands if this option is specified.

     -mfp-arg-in-gregs
          Use the normal calling convention  for  floating  point
          arguments.  This is the default.

     -mhc-struct-return
          Return structures of more  than  one  word  in  memory,
          rather than in a register.  This provides compatibility
          with   the   MetaWare   HighC   (hc)   compiler.    Use
          `-fpcc-struct-return'  for compatibility with the Port-
          able C Compiler (pcc).

     -mnohc-struct-return
          Return some structures of more than one word in  regis-
          ters,  when convenient.  This is the default.  For com-
          patibility with the IBM-supplied compilers, use  either
          `-fpcc-struct-return' or `-mhc-struct-return'.

     These `-m' options are defined for the MIPS family  of  com-
     puters:

     -mcpu=cpu-type
          Assume the defaults for the machine type cpu-type  when
          scheduling  insturctions.   The default cpu-type is de-
          fault, which picks the longest cycles times for any  of
          the  machines, in order that the code run at reasonable
          rates on all MIPS cpu's.  Other  choices  for  cpu-type
          are  r2000,  r3000,  r4000, and r6000.  While picking a
          specific cpu-type will  schedule  things  appropriately
          for  that  particular  chip, the compiler will not gen-
          erate any code that does not meet level 1 of  the  MIPS
          ISA  (instruction  set architecture) without the -mips2
          or -mips3 switches being used.

     -mips2
          Issue instructions from level 2 of the MIPS ISA (branch
          likely,  square root instructions).  The -mcpu=r4000 or
          -mcpu=r6000 switch must  be  used  in  conjuction  with
          -mips2.

     -mips3
          Issue instructions from level 3 of the MIPS ISA (64 bit
          instructions).   The -mcpu=r4000 switch must be used in
          conjuction with -mips2.

     -mint64

     -mlong64

     -mlonglong128
          These options don't work at present.

     -mmips-as
          Generate  code  for  the  MIPS  assembler,  and  invoke
          mips-tfile  to  add  normal debug information.  This is
          the default for all  platforms  except  for  the  OSF/1
          reference  platform,  using the OSF/rose object format.
          If the any of the -ggdb, -gstabs, or -gstabs+  switches
          are  used,  the mips-tfile program will encapsulate the
          stabs within MIPS ECOFF.

     -mgas
          Generate code for the GNU assembler.  This is  the  de-
          fault  on  the  OSF/1  reference  platform,  using  the
          OSF/rose object format.

     -mrnames

     -mno-rnames
          The -mrnames switch says to output code using the  MIPS
          software  names  for  the  registers,  instead  of  the
          hardware names (ie, a0 instead of $4).  The GNU  assem-
          bler does not support the -mrnames switch, and the MIPS
          assembler will be instructed to run the MIPS C  prepro-
          cessor over the source file.  The -mno-rnames switch is
          default.

     -mgpopt

     -mno-gpopt
          The -mgpopt switch says to write all of  the  data  de-
          clarations before the instructions in the text section,
          to all the MIPS assembler to generate one  word  memory
          references  instead of using two words for short global
          or static data items.  This is on by default if optimi-
          zation is selected.

     -mstats

     -mno-stats
          For each non-inline  function  processed,  the  -mstats
          switch  causes  the  compiler  to  emit one line to the
          standard error file to print statistics about the  pro-
          gram (number of registers saved, stack size, etc.).

     -mmemcpy

     -mno-memcpy
          The -mmemcpy switch makes all block moves call the  ap-
          propriate  string function (memcpy or bcopy) instead of
          possibly generating inline code.

     -mmips-tfile

     -mno-mips-tfile
          The -mno-mips-tfile  switch  causes  the  compiler  not
          postprocess  the  object  file with the mips-tfile pro-
          gram, after the MIPS assembler has generated it to  add
          debug support.  If mips-tfile is not run, then no local
          variables will be available to the debugger.  In  addi-
          tion, stage2 and stage3 objects will have the temporary
          file names passed to the assembler embedded in the  ob-
          ject file, which means the objects will not compare the
          same.

     -msoft-float
          Generate output containing library calls  for  floating
          point.   WARNING:  the requisite libraries are not part
          of GNU CC.  Normally the facilities  of  the  machine's
          usual  C  compiler  are  used,  but  this can't be done
          directly in cross-compilation.  You must make your  own
          arrangements  to provide suitable library functions for
          cross-compilation.

     -mhard-float
          Generate output containing floating point instructions.
          This is the default if you use the unmodified sources.

     -mfp64
          Assume that the FR bit in the status word  is  on,  and
          that  there are 32 64-bit floating point registers, in-
          stead of 32 32-bit floating point registers.  You  must
          also specify the -mcpu=r4000 and -mips3 switches.

     -mfp32
          Assume that there are 32 32-bit floating  point  regis-
          ters.  This is the default.

     -mabicalls
          The -mabicalls  switch  says  to  emit  the  .abicalls,
          .cpload,  and  .cprestore  pseudo  operations that some
          System V.4 ports use for position independent code.

     -mhalf-pic

     -mno-half-pic
          The -mhalf-pic switch says to put  pointers  to  extern
          references  into  the  data  section  and load them up,
          rather than put the references  in  the  text  section.
          This option does not work at present.  -Gnum Put global
          and static items less than or equal to num  bytes  into
          the  small  data  or bss sections instead of the normal
          data or bss section.  This allows the assembler to emit
          one  word  memory  reference  instructions based on the
          global pointer (gp or $28), instead of the  normal  two
          words  used.  By default, num is 8 when the MIPS assem-
          bler is used, and 0 when the  GNU  assembler  is  used.
          The  -Gnum  switch  is also passed to the assembler and
          linker.  All modules should be compiled with  the  same
          -Gnum value.

CODE GENERATION OPTIONS
     These machine-independent options control the interface con-
     ventions used in code generation.

     Most of them begin with `-f'.  These options have both posi-
     tive  and negative forms; the negative form of `-ffoo' would
     be `-fno-foo'.  In the table below, only one of the forms is
     listed-the one which is not the default.  You can figure out
     the other form by either removing `no-' or adding it.

     +eN  (C++ only.) control whether  virtual  function  defini-
          tions  in classes are used to generate code, or only to
          define interfaces for their callers.  These options are
          provided  for  compatibility with cfront 1.x usage; the
          recommended GNU C++ usage is to use  #pragma  interface
          and #pragma implementation, instead.

          With `+e0', virtual function definitions in classes are
          declared extern; the declaration is used only as an in-
          terface specification, not to  generate  code  for  the
          virtual functions (in this compilation).

          With `+e1', g++ actually generates the code  implement-
          ing  virtual  functions  defined in the code, and makes
          them publicly visible.

     -fnonnull-objects
          (C++ only.) Normally, GNU C++  makes  conservative  as-
          sumptions  about  objects  reached  through references.
          For example, the compiler must check that  `a'  is  not
          null in code like the following:
              obj &a = g ();
              a.f (2);
          Checking that references of  this  sort  have  non-null
          values requires extra code, however, and it is unneces-
          sary    for    many    programs.     You    can     use
          `-fnonnull-objects'  to  omit  the  checks for null, if
          your program doesn't require the default checking.

     -fpcc-struct-return
          Use the same convention for returning struct and  union
          values  that  is  used  by the usual C compiler on your
          system.  This convention is less  efficient  for  small
          structures,  and  on many machines it fails to be reen-
          trant; but it has the advantage of allowing intercalla-
          bility between GCC-compiled code and PCC-compiled code.

     -fshort-enums
          Allocate to an enum type only as many bytes as it needs
          for the declared range of possible values.  Specifical-
          ly, the enum type will be equivalent  to  the  smallest
          integer type which has enough room.

     -fshort-double
          Use the same size for double as for float .

     -fshared-data
          Requests that the data and non-const variables of  this
          compilation  be  shared  data rather than private data.
          The distinction makes sense only on  certain  operating
          systems,  where shared data is shared between processes
          running the same program, while private data exists  in
          one copy per process.

     -fno-common
          Allocate even uninitialized global variables in the bss
          section of the object file, rather than generating them
          as common blocks.  This has the effect that if the same
          variable  is declared (without extern) in two different
          compilations, you will get an error when you link them.
          The  only reason this might be useful is if you wish to
          verify that the program  will  work  on  other  systems
          which always work this way.

     -fvolatile
          Consider all memory references through pointers  to  be
          volatile.

     -fpic
          If  supported  for  the   target   machines,   generate
          position-independent code, suitable for use in a shared
          library.

     -fPIC
          If supported for the  target  machine,  emit  position-
          independent code, suitable for dynamic linking, even if
          branches need large displacements.

     -ffixed-reg
           Treat the register named reg as a fixed register; gen-
          erated code should never refer to it (except perhaps as
          a stack pointer, frame pointer or in some  other  fixed
          role).

          reg must be the name of a register.  The register names
          accepted  are  machine-specific  and are defined in the
          REGISTER_NAMES macro in the machine  description  macro
          file.

          This flag does not have a  negative  form,  because  it
          specifies a three-way choice.

     -fcall-used-reg
           Treat the register named reg as an allocatable  regis-
          ter that is clobbered by function calls.  It may be al-
          located for temporaries or variables that do  not  live
          across  a  call.   Functions compiled this way will not
          save and restore the register reg.

          Use of this flag for a register that has a  fixed  per-
          vasive  role  in the machine's execution model, such as
          the stack pointer or frame pointer, will produce disas-
          trous results.

          This flag does not have a  negative  form,  because  it
          specifies a three-way choice.

     -fcall-saved-reg
           Treat the register named reg as an allocatable  regis-
          ter  saved  by functions.  It may be allocated even for
          temporaries or  variables  that  live  across  a  call.
          Functions  compiled  this way will save and restore the
          register reg if they use it.

          Use of this flag for a register that has a  fixed  per-
          vasive  role  in the machine's execution model, such as
          the stack pointer or frame pointer, will produce disas-
          trous results.

          A different sort of disaster will result from  the  use
          of  this  flag  for a register in which function values
          may be returned.

          This flag does not have a  negative  form,  because  it
          specifies a three-way choice.

     -fgnu-binutils

     -fno-gnu-binutils
          (C++ only.) `-fgnu-binutils ' (the  default  for  most,
          but not all, platforms) makes GNU C++ emit extra infor-
          mation  for  static  initialization  and  finalization.
          This information has to be passed from the assembler to
          the GNU linker.  Some assemblers won't pass this infor-
          mation;  you  must either use GNU as or specify the op-
          tion `-fno-gnu-binutils'.

          With `-fno-gnu-binutils', you must use the program col-
          lect (part of the GCC distribution) for linking.

PRAGMAS
     Two `#pragma' directives are supported for GNU C++, to  per-
     mit using the same header file for two purposes: as a defin-
     ition of interfaces to a given object class, and as the full
     definition of the contents of that object class.

     #pragma interface
          (C++ only.) Use this directive in header files that de-
          fine  object  classes, to save space in most of the ob-
          ject files that use  those  classes.   Normally,  local
          copies  of certain information (backup copies of inline
          member functions, debugging information, and the inter-
          nal  tables  that  implement virtual functions) must be
          kept in each object file that  includes  class  defini-
          tions.   You can use this pragma to avoid such duplica-
          tion.  When a header file  containing  `#pragma  inter-
          face'  is included in a compilation, this auxiliary in-
          formation will not be generated (unless the main  input
          source file itself uses `#pragma implementation').  In-
          stead, the object files will contain references  to  be
          resolved at link time.

     #pragma implementation

     #pragma implementation "objects.h"
          (C++ only.) Use this pragma in a main input file,  when
          you  want  full output from included header files to be
          generated (and made globally  visible).   The  included
          header  file,  in turn, should use `#pragma interface'.
          Backup copies of inline member functions, debugging in-
          formation,  and  the  internal tables used to implement
          virtual functions are all generated  in  implementation
          files.

          If you use `#pragma implementation' with  no  argument,
          it applies to an include file with the same basename as
          your  source  file;  for  example,  in   `allclass.cc',
          `#pragma  implementation'  by  itself  is equivalent to
          `#pragma implementation "allclass.h"'.  Use the  string
          argument  if  you  want a single implementation file to
          include code from multiple header files.

          There is no way to split up the contents  of  a  single
          header file into multiple implementation files.
