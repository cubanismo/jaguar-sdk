MADMAC Feature Additions/Changes
--------------------------------

29-jan-1994 --- Raphael Lemoine - Brainstorm

The MadMac assembler given with the Jaguar development kit differs from the
original MadMac.  Here is the list of all current changes.  It's divided in
three parts( new functions, changes, and GPU/DSP syntax):

*****************
* NEW FUNCTIONS *
*****************

- '.GPU' and '.DSP' directives added, for switching to GPU/DSP assembly
  mode.  These directives MUST be used when the current section is 'TEXT' or
  'DATA'.  To return to 68000 assembly, use the directive '.68000'.


- '.JPAD' and '.NOJPAD' directives added, for turning on/off NOP padding
  after every JUMP/JR instructions, in GPU/DSP mode.  Each time you declare a
  GPU/DSP section, padding is reset to its default condition (off).


- '.CLEAR' and '.NOCLEAR' directives added, which allow/forbid the use of
  the 'CLR.L memory' instructions (this doesn't work on the Jaguar).  Default
  state is '.CLEAR' (CLR.L memory allowed).  By 'memory', I mean: (An), (An)+,
  -(An), d16(An), d8(An,Nx), abs.w, abs.l.


- '.LONG', '.PHRASE' and '.DPHRASE' directives added, which align the
  CURRENT section to 32, 64 and 128 bits boundary.  Note that GPU/DSP
  instructions have no specific section, they are just stored in the current
  section (TEXT or DATA).  If you want to align GPU/DSP code, align the
  current section BEFORE and AFTER the GPU/DSP code.


- '.EQUR' directive added, which allow you to name a register.  It is only
  implemented in GPU/DSP sections, declaring/using a named register is
  forbidden in 68000/6502 sections.  ie:

	ClipW .EQUR r18
	ClipH .EQUR r19


- '.EQURUNDEF' directive added, which undefine one/several previously
  declared '.EQUR'.  ie:

	.EQURUNDEF ClipW,ClipH


- '.CCDEF' directive added, for naming GPU/DSP JUMP/JR condition codes.  ie:

	Always  .CCDEF  0
		jump    Always,(r3)


- '.CCUNDEF' directive added, which undefine one/several previously declared
  '.CCDEF'.  ie:

	.CCUNDEF        Always


- '.INCBIN' directive added, which include a binary file in your source.
  The syntax is the same as the '.INCLUDE' directive, except that if the
  filename has no suffix, MadMac will add automatically a '.BIN' instead of a
  '.S'.

- '.DC' takes a new size: .DC.I generates a long word-swapped (as in MOVEI
  instruction).

- All GPU/DSP instructions are assembled, when in GPU/DSP mode (see above).

- MadMac takes several new flags in the command line:

  * In addition to -fa (generate DRI object file) and -fm (MWC object file),
    -fb generates BSD object files.  Those are symbols length unlimited.  In
    addition to -fb, one can add the -g option which generates source-level
    information for use under RDBJAG.  (Please note that you must also set the
    -e -g flags in ALN command line if you want to have the source-level).
    The standard BSD object file format has also been extended to support the
    MOVEI relocation, but not the DRI.  So,

	       PLEASE USE -fb WHEN DEVELOPPING FOR JAGUAR

  * The -a <text> <data> <bss> option has been also added.  This follows the
    same syntax as in ALN, except that the 'r' switch is not supported.  This
    will generate a DRI .ABS file.  In this case, you have no possibility to
    get source-level info nor symbols length greater than 8 caracters.  But
    you will be able to directly load it under RDBJAG (without the ALN step).
    This allows quick assembly for test purposes only.  Use -as to have
    symbols (same as -ps).

  * The -c<dsp/gpu> flag acts like the '-cdsp' and '-cgpu' flags in GASM.
    You can mix it with '-fb' for BSD output and '-g' for source level.

  * The -r<size> flag, which force 2/4/8/16/32 bytes alignment on the TEXT/
    DATA and BSS sections:

    -rw for word alignment (2 bytes, default alignment)
    -rl for long alignment (4 bytes)
    -rp for phrase alignment (8 bytes)
    -rd for double phrase alignment (16 bytes)
    -rq for quad phrase alignment (32 bytes)


***********
* CHANGES *
***********

- You cannot use R0->R15 register names in 68000 mode anymore.  Use instead
  D0->D7, A0->A7, and SP register names.


- '.UNDEFMAC' directive name changed to '.MACUNDEF'.


- '.INIT', '.CARGS', '.TEXT', '.DATA' and '.BSS' directives are forbidden in
  GPU/DSP mode.

- '.ABS' directive name changed to '.OFFSET', to avoid conflicts with the
  'ABS' GPU/DSP instruction.

- '.NLIST' directive name changed to '.NOLIST', for compatibility with most
  assemblers.


******************
* GPU/DSP SYNTAX *
******************

- The following condition codes are built-in:

	CC (%00100)     CS (%01000)     EQ (%00010)     MI (%11000)
	NE (%00001)     PL (%10100)     HI (%00101)     T (%00000).

  ie:
	jump    CS,(r3)


- Use the '#' character before any constant/expression.  ie:

	bset    #2,r5
	cmpq    #3,r2


- MadMac tests all GPU/DSP restrictions, and correct them whenever possible
  (inserting a NOP).


- The '(Rx+N)' addressing mode is optimized to (Rx), if N=0 (a warning is
  displayed).

- Backpatch is performed only in all instructions.




Changes to MADMAC
-----------------

11-dec-1993
-----------

- First successful compilation of the original MadMac (on Falcon030).

- directive '.gpu' added

- All GPU instructions added according to the Software Reference Manual (27
  July, 1993, Version 2.1).  Only the opcodes are recognized.

- directives 'org', 'even', 'bss', 'data', 'text', 'abs', 'comm', 'init',
  'cargs', 'goto', 'dc', 'ds', 'undefmac', 'dcb', 'dump', 'load', 'disable',
  'enable', 'globl', 'extern', 'assert', 'include', 'end', 'list', 'nlist',
  'title', 'subttl', 'eject', 'error', 'warn' removed.  The main reason was a
  possible conflict between the directive 'abs' and the GPU/DSP instruction
  'abs'.  Note that the MadMac manual specifies 'The leading periods are
  optional, though they are shown here and their use is encouraged.'.  You
  MUST now use them (i.e.  '.org', '.even', '.bss')...



12-dec-1993
-----------

- Tokens R0, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, R11, R12, R13, R14,
  R15 removed from MC68000 assembling mode, in order to avoid conflicts
  between MC68000/GPU/DSP registers.  You MUST now use D0->D7 A0->A7/SP in
  .68000 mode.

- '#' character MUST be used before any constant value or expression, in
  GPU/DSP adressing modes.  This is mainly for maintaining coherency between
  MC6800/GPU/DSP modes.  ie:

	bclr    #0,r0
	bset    #1,r1
	movei   #$deadbeef,r2

- Current error messages from the GPU assembler:

	Missing Register R0...R31.
	Register R0...R31 expected.
	Missing Register PC | R0...R31.
	Register PC | R0...R31 expected.
	Comma expected.
	Parenthesis Expected.

- Current warning messages from the GPU assembler:

	Extra comma ignored.
	Opcode size ignored.

- 8 of the 12 GPU adressing mode written (no EQUR recognition).

- '.init', '.cargs', '.text', '.data', '.bss' directives forbidden in '.gpu'
  section.


13-dec-1993
-----------

- Expressions are now handled in adressing modes. ie:

    lf      .equ    $a
	    bset    #(lf+2),r1

- '.jpad' and '.nojpad' directives added and handled.  Each time you declare
  a '.gpu' section, padding is reset to its default state (.nojpad).
  '.jpad' means: add a nop after every jump/jr.

- 'JR+MOVIE', 'JUMP+MOVIE', 'JR+JR', 'JR+JUMP', 'JUMP+JR', 'JUMP+JUMP',
  'JR+MOVE PC', 'JUMP+ MOVE PC' GPU restrictions tested: A warning is
  displayed, and a NOP instruction is inserted.  Note that this cannot append
  when padding mode is ON (.jpad).  i.e.:

	.jpad
	jr      EZ,(r4)
	movei   #$12345678,r2

  is converted to:

	jr      EZ,(r4)
	nop
	movei   #$12345678,r2



	.jnopad
	jr      EZ,(r4)
	movei   #$12345678,r2

  is converted to:

	jr      EZ,(r4)
	nop                      ; *** WARNING DISPLAYED ***
	movei   #$12345678,r2



	.jpad
	jr      EZ,(r4)
	abs     r6

  is converted to:

    .jpad
	jr     EZ,(r4)
	nop
	abs    r6


	.jnopad
	jr      EZ,(r4)
	abs     r6

  remains unchanged.



14-dec-1993
-----------

- A macro can't be given a GPU mnemonic name (in GPU section).

- '.leven' and '.peven' directives added (in 68000 and gpu sections).
  '.leven' is "long align (4 bytes)", '.peven' is "phrase align (8 bytes)".

- Default JUMP cc/JR cc conditions are: cc, cs, eq, mi, ne, pl, hi.  You can
  use an expression too (equates will be replaced by ccdef later...).  i.e.:

	    jump    eq,(r2)

    equal   .equ    2
	    jump    equal,(r2)

- The last GPU/DSP restrictions are now tested:

    IMULTN must be followed by a IMACN (Error displayed)
    IMACN must be followed by a IMACN or RESMAC (Error displayed)
    RESMAC must be preceed by a IMACN (Error displayed)
    a NOP is inserted between LOAD+MMULT and STORE+MMULT (Warning displayed).
    I don't know if LOADB+MMULT, LOADW+MMULT, LOADP+MMULT, ... are valid or
    not. Currently, it's not tested...

- Here are the current warning/error messages displayed by the GPU
  assembler:

    missing register R0...R31.
    register R0...R31 expected.
    missing register PC | R0...R31.
    register PC | R0...R31 expected.
    extra comma ignored.
    opcode size ignored.
    comma expected.
    parenthesis expected.
    diesis expected.
    constant expected.
    constant overflow/underflow.
    constant unresolved.
    invalid expression.
    NOP inserted before MOVIE instruction.
    NOP inserted before MOVE PC instruction.
    NOP inserted before JR/JUMP instruction.
    invalid JR/JUMP condition mask.
    IMACN instruction expected.
    IMULTN/IMACN instruction must precede IMACN instruction.
    IMACN instruction must precede RESMAC instruction.
    NOP inserted before MMULT instruction.



15-dec-1993
-----------

- The '.equr' directive has just been added.  It's not handled everywhere...

- The 'procln.c' and 'token.c' files have been 'cleaned'.



16-dec-1993
-----------

- '.equr' directive handled in all currently done GPU adressing modes.

- I don't know if the 6502 assembler is still working, since I had to patch
  MadMac in a lot of critical routines, and I don't have time/sources for
  testing it.

- GPU code is now encapsulated in the current 68000 section.  So, you must
  define GPU code '.gpu directive' when you're in TEXT or DATA section.
  Otherwise, a fatal error occurs (BSS section cannot contains initialised
  datas).

- There is currently a BIG BUG in the macro management: The macros are
  simply ignored!



17-dec-1993
-----------

- the macro bug is fixed (ouf!).



18-dec-1993
-----------

- The .gpu section is not a REAL section anymore, since the gpu code is
  encapsulated in the current (TEXT/DATA) section.  This whould have caused
  some problems in the backpatching, probably.

  - The .68000 directive now just set the assembler to 68000 mode, without
  section reinitialisation.  i.e.:


	; start of source (default section is TEXT, 68000 assembling)

	    nop                 ; some 68000 instructions...

	    .data               ; Now, we're in the data section
	    .dc.l   $12345678   ; some 68000 datas...

	    .gpu                ; now, switch to GPU mode
	    nop                 ; some gpu datas/instructions...

	    .68000              ; return in the 68000 mode, IN DATA SECTION!
	    .dc.l   $87654321   ; some 68000 datas...

	    .text               ; return to text section
	    nop                 ; some 68000 instructions...

	    .end                ; end of source

- T flag added in cc (JUMP/JR) default conditions: T stands for TRUE, so
  it's branch always (it can be useful, sometimes :-).

- A big look at the backpatching routines, all night (Ah, what a wonderful
  saturday night, hem hem...).



19-dec-1993
-----------

- All adressing mode written.

- 32 bits absolute backpatch done (MOVIE instruction).

- Bug fix in the JR cc,n instruction.

- Bug fix in 32 bits e.a.: The 32 bits are now stored in the order 'low
  word|high word'.  THIS IS NOT SPECIFIED IN THE DOCS!!!

- ABOUT THE BUG FIX DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE GPU DOCS AND THE GASM DOCS ARE VERY
  AMBIGUOUS.  IT COULD BE A VERY GOOD THING TO HAVE THE OFFICIAL VERSION OF
  HIGH/LOW WORD ORDERING.  i.e.:

    'movie #$12345678,r0' is encoded  like this:    xxxx 5678 1234 (xxxx=opcode)

    '.dc.l $12345678' is encoded like this:         1234 5678

  (I follow the word ordering produced by GASM).

- All backpatch is finally done!  JAGMAND is running, assembled with MadMac!
  (I really have to rewrite this horribly slow Mandelbrot code...).



20-dec-1993
-----------

- '.dsp' directive added.  SINCE THE ONLY GPU/DSP SOURCE I HAVE IS
  'JAGMAND', I ABSOLUTELY CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT ALL GPU/DSP INSTRUCTIONS ARE
  ENCODED PROPERLY.  WE ASKED FOR GPU/DSP SOURCES LAST WEEK, BUT HAVE RECEIVED
  NOTHING YET...

- DSP specific instructions added.

- Job done!!! PC/DOS port, and GPU/DSP code generator in MadMac, all this
  before the 21th of december!!!



21-dec-1993
-----------

- '.ccdef directive' added.  You must now use them, in jr/jump conditions
  ('.equ' are now refused).

- Clarification about '.leven' and '.peven': These directives align the
  current section size to a 4/8 bytes multiple.  Since the GPU and DSP
  sections are not real sections (at least for MadMac), the alignment is
  relative to the TEXT/ DATA section containing the DSP/GPU code.  i.e.:

	    .text
	    nop
	    .gpu
	    nop
	    .leven
	    .end

  generates:
	    4e71            ; 68000 NOP (68000 section = 2 bytes)
	    e400            ; GPU NOP (GPU section = 2 bytes)

    The GPU section contains only 2 bytes, even with a '.leven' directive.

	    .text
	    nop
	    .leven
	    .gpu
	    nop
	    .leven
	    .end

  generates:
	    4e71            ; 68000 NOP
	    0000            ; First '.leven' padding (68000 section = 4 bytes)
	    e400            ; GPU NOP
	    0000            ; Second '.leven' padding (GPU section = 4 bytes)


- Clarification about GPU/DSP symbols reference by the 68000 code.  When a
  68000 instruction uses a symbol defined in a GPU/DSP section, THE VALUE OF
  THE SYMBOL IS THE ORG'ed VALUE.  i.e.:

	    .68000
	    move.l  #LocCode,a0         ; Code location address
	    move.l  #ExecCode,a1        ; Code execution address ($f03000)

    ; both lines below have the same meaning...
	    moveq   #((EndExecCode-ExecCode)/4)-1,d0 ; Code Size -1
	    moveq   #((EndLocCode-LocCode)/4)-1,d0 ; Code Size -1
    .Loop:
	    move.l  (a0)+,(a1)+
	    dbf     d0,.Loop

	    .gpu

	    .leven                      ; Align Start of GPU code

    LocCode:                            ; Symbol defined before '.ORG'
	    .org    $f03000
    ExecCode:                           ; Symbol defined after '.ORG'
	    abs     r0
	    nop
	    add     r2,r15
	    .leven                      ; GPU code size is now a multiple of 4
    EndExecCode:
	    .68000                      ; Return to 68000 mode.
    EndLocCode:
	    nop
	    nop
	    nop



22-dec-1993
-----------

- Message 'Writing object' removed. It was a debug message...

- '.leven' directive replaced by '.long' (wish from Atari Corp.).

- '.peven' directive replaced by '.phrase' (wish from Atari Corp.).

- Macro bug fixed (thanks, Normen! I think I'm going to pay you a couple of
  beers, at the next CeBIT:-).



24-dec-1993
-----------


- GPU/DSP code is automatically even aligned.  i.e.:

		nop
		.dc.b    $27
		nop

  is assembled as:

		e400
		2700                      ; <- 1 Byte (00) inserted
		e400

- Some debug messages removed (in .endif management):

    /* WARNING KLUDGE LT HACK */
    printf("In d_endif\n");
    /* WARNING KLUDGE LT HACK */
    printf("Leaving d_endif\n");

  They were always displayed, whatever were the compilation options.


- '.ccundef' directive added, which remove a previously defined .ccdef.
  .i.e:

    A   .ccdef  0
    B   .ccdef  1
    C   .ccdef  2

	.ccundef   A,B,C

- '.equrundef' directive added, which remove a previously defined .equr.

- '.undefmac' directive name changed to '.macundef' (mainly for coherency
  with the two above new functions).

- Bug in 'MOVEFA' and 'MOVETA' fixed (tested with TURTLE demo).



25-dec-1993
-----------

- Bug in 'STORE', 'STOREB', 'STOREW', 'STOREP' fixed (tested with TURTLE demo).

- Bug in 'dc.l Address' fixed, in GPU/DSP section (tested with TURTLE demo).

- The TURTLE demo is now running perfectly (all sources assembled by MadMac).
  The assembled files 'TURTDEMO.TXT' and 'TURTDEMO.DTA' are identical to
  those assembled by the old MadMac and Gasm. The 'TURTDEMO.SYM' file is bigger,
  since the GPU symbols are now generated.

- Some compiler warning removed in 'DIRECT.C', 'TOKEN.C', 'SYMBOL.C',
  'LISTING.C' and 'MACRO.C' sources.

- All night cleaning all sources (cleaning everything should take about one
  week)...



26-dec-1993
-----------

- All functions prototyped (file 'PROTO.H', done with MKPTYPES.TTP program
  from Eric Smith).

- '-Wall' added in compiler options (all warnings on).

- All warnings/errors removed in 'PROCLN.C', 'AMAC.C', 'AMODE.C', 'SECT.C',
  and 'DIRECT.C' ('PROTO.H' included in these files).



27-dec-1993

5-jan-1994
----------

- Received Telegames bug report.  The 'STOREW bug' was fixed last year:-).
  The 'internal error 6' bug is already here:-(.

- Listing generator bug fixed (internal error 6).  Many thanks to David
  Mahaffey @ Telegames, for the bug report!  The bug reason was not 'big
  source file', it was 'file with ORG'ed GPU code'.

- Macro bug tested.  It seems to be the bug I removed last year:-).  This
  small source is assembled with no problem:

    .macro  _move   src,dst             ; macro with 2 arguments
    move    \src,\dst
    .endm

    _move   d0,24(a0)                   ; no problem...

- Some patches performed for source level generation (in macros 'D_Word',
  and 'D_OpWord').  Source level will be implemented only in 68000, GPU and
  DSP sections (not in 6502).


6-jan-1994
-----------

- Received bug report from Scott Le Grand.  The reported bug seems to have
  been fixed last year:-)

- The listing lines now end with 'CR/LF' instead of 'LF' (wish from David
  Mahaffey @ Telegames).

- '.dphrase' directive added.  It remember seeing a fax where somebody was
  complaining about the lack of a 'double phrase' alignment directive, for the
  object processor...  ('.dphrase' perform alignment to a 16 bytes boundary).
  It's now done.

- The section code is automatically even aligned when entering to/exiting
  from a GPU/DSP section (a 0 byte is inserted, if needed).  i.e.:

	.68000
	.dc.b   $12
	.gpu
	.dc.b   $34
	.68000
	.dc.b   $56
	...

  is assembled as:
	$12,$00,$34,$00,$56

7-jan-1994
----------

+ Now outputs ".ABS" directly.  This is done with the -a option, which
  follows the same syntax as in ALN with one add:

  -a ...  will output a .ABS file without symbols (unless there are unresolved
  references, see below).

  -as ...  will output a .ABS file with symbols (as in -ps).  and one lack: it
  doesn't handle today 'mixed' abs definitions (the 'r' option) since it is
  not necessary for Jaguar.

  NB: Since it is allowed to have unresolved external references in a .ABS
  file , you will get a warning if so (due to Jaguar's point of view).
  Anyway, RDB will refuse to 'aread' such a file.  While doing that job, I
  noted that PC-relatives references across sections are forbidden.  So it
  cannot be output in .ABS files :=(.

11-jan-1994
-----------

+ Now outputs BSD object files.  Tested with ALN and turtdemo.  Seems ok.
  Use it with <-fb> in command line.  (COFF object output will be -fc ...).
  Same comment as above for PC-rel references across sections.

13-jan-1994
-----------

+ Changed error messages to suit PC/DOS most frequent syntax.

    Old style:  "test.s",line 4: error message

    New style:  test.s[4]:Error:error message.

    (Same for warnings and fatals).

    Thanks to Frederic Marcus and Stephane Bellanger @ Ubi Soft.
    They also have given the macros for use under the Brief editor.


16-jan-1994
-----------

+ Source level is done.  Use the -g option to get it.  It works only with
  BSD object files, so you must use the '-fb' option also.  Otherwise you will
  have a DRI object file without any source level.  (ALN and RDB don't handle
  it yet).

17-jan-1994
-----------

+ Changed the above error message (Jan. 13) to:

    test.s(4): Error: error message.
    (due to CCITT T4 ;=(). Thanks again to Frederic Markus.



18-jan-1994
-----------

- Raphael is back!

- External symbols are now allowed in GPU/DSP sections (only in .dc.l, since
  MOVEI address encoding use 'LWord/HWord' ordering, which isn't currently a
  known ALN patch format).

- '.clear' and '.noclear' directives added, which allow/forbid the use of
  the 'clr.l memory' instruction.  Default is '.clear' ('clr.l memory'
  allowed).  'memory' is: (An), (An)+, -(An), d16(An), d8(An,Nx), abs.w,
  abs.l.  So, 'clr.l Dn' and 'clr.l An' (converted by the assembler to 'suba.l
  An,An') are always allowed.

- 'load (Rx+0),Ry' converted to 'load (Rx),Ry' (Rx=R14 or R15).  Warning
  'NULL offset removed' displayed.

- 'store Rx,(Ry+0)' converted to 'store Rx,(Ry)' (Ry=R14 or R15). Warning
  'NULL offset removed' displayed.

- '.abs' directive name changed to '.offset', in order to avoid conflict
  with the 'abs' GPU/DSP instruction.

- '.nlist' directive changed to '.nolist', for compatibility with most
  assemblers, including GASM.

- directives 'org', 'even', 'bss', 'data', 'text', 'offset', 'comm', 'init',
  'cargs', 'goto', 'dc', 'ds', 'macundef', 'dcb', 'globl', 'assert',
  'include', 'end', 'list', 'nolist', 'title', 'subttl', 'eject', 'gpu',
  'jpad', 'nojpad', 'long', 'phrase', 'dsp', 'ccundef', 'equrundef',
  'dphrase', 'clear', 'noclear', 'if', 'else', 'endif', 'iif', 'macro',
  'endm', 'rept', 'endr', 'exitm', 'equ', 'set', 'reg', 'equr', 'ccdef' added!
  Yes, the dot is now optional!  A miracle, it's a miracle!!!  The only
  directives that need a dot are now only '.68000' and '.6502'.



19-jan-1994
-----------

- Received bug report from Normen, about the problem Rebellion software
  found: invalid symbols management when declaring a GPU/DSP section in DATA
  section.  The bug is fixed.

19-jan-1994
-----------

- Fixed a bug in source level: the source name was always the last one.
  (ALN seems ok now with source level, RDB is at work).

    + Source name is stored in absolute.

    + Added O_TRUNC flag to open (...) for object files.



20-jan-1994
-----------

- 'incbin' directive added, which include a binary file in your source.  The
  syntax is the same as the 'include' directive, except that, if no suffixe is
  specified in the filename, Madmac will add a '.bin' instead of '.s' (wish
  from Frederic Markus @ Ubisoft).



21-jan-1994
-----------

- Received the message from John Carmack @ ID Software.  The 'EQUR' bug is
  fixed.  Thanks for the bug report!!!

- Fixed A VERY BIG BUG in GPU/DSP memory management, which was probably
  appearing with big GPU/DSP sections (more than 2048 bytes of code).



24-jan-1994
-----------

- Received the 'equr wish' from John Carmack @ ID Software.  You can now
  define an 'equr' with another 'equr'.  i.e.:

    newvar  equr    oldvar


25-jan-1994
-----------

- Received the (big) bug report from John Mitchell:

  1: '.list' doesn't work.

  No, it does (at least in my tests).  The thing that probably confused you is
  that '.list/.nolist' are active only if you specify the '-l' option in
  MadMac command line.  For more details, please read the MadMac manual.

  3: Offsets are required to constants outside of GPU area (linker)?

  Sorry, but I don't understand what you mean exactly.  Could you be more
  precise?  (a small sample source should be perfect).


  4: This does not work:

  reg14     .equr       r14
	    load        r0,(reg14+2)

  It was fixed on 21-jan-1994 (previous bug report from John Carmack).


  7: GPU accepts:
	    moveq       #0,(r0)
	and
	    move        r0,(r1)
	which are common mistakes for
	    store       #0,(r0)
	    store       r0,(r1)

  ???  If you mean that MadMac currently accepts the two first lines in
  GPU/DSP section, the answer is NO.  If it's a thing you want us to
  implement, no problem if Normen or Bill are OK (it will change the standard
  GPU/DSP instructions defined in the Jaguar specs).  Note that only 'move
  Rx,(Ry)' can be converted to 'store Rx,(Ry)'.  'store #xx,(Ry)' doesn't
  exist, at least in my Jaguar:-) The other problems are related to RDBJAG.
  So, look at the RDBJAG.TXT file.

- Small bug fixed in source level generation (line numbers-1).



21-feb-1994
-----------

- 'regequ' and '.regequ' directives added, for GASM backward compatibility
  (wish from Normen Kowalewski).

- 'nlist' and '.nlist' directives added, for MadMac backward compatibility
  (wish from Normen Kowalewski).

- 'qphrase' and '.qphrase' directives added, for quad phrase (32 bytes)
  alignment (wish from Normen Kowalewski).

- 'UNPACK' encoding bug fixed (bug report from Rebellion Software).

- Using 'equrundef' and 'ccundef' on an undefined 'equr/ccdef' was crashing.
  This is fixed (bug report from Rebellion Software).

- short branch (68000) encoding bug fixed: It was ALWAYS assembled as a word
  branch.

- Added the following 'INTEL like' built-in condition codes: 'A', 'NBE',
  'AE', 'NB', 'B', 'NAE', 'E', 'NE', 'NZ', 'NS', 'S'.  They are the same as
  GASM JR/JUMP condition codes, for backward compatibility (wish from Normen
  Kowalewski).

- Bug fixed, in the 68000<->GPU/DSP references, when the 68000 declaration
  was in DATA/BSS section, and the reference in a GPU/DSP section (-fb in
  MadMac command line, of course!) (bug report from Rebellion Software and
  Virtual Xperience).



25-feb-1994
-----------

- All 5 bits forward references are now backpatched.  You can write:

	    addq    #toto,r0        ; 'toto' not already defined...
    toto    equ     8               ; 'toto' definition

  Note that you can't use external definition/reference, only forward
  references (wish from Rebellion Software).



28-feb-1994
-----------

- Added '-?' command line flag (wish from Rebellion Software).



01-mar-1994
-----------

- Added '-r' flag in MadMac command line, for padding all sections (TEXT,
  DATA and BSS) to a 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 bytes boundary.  Syntax is:

  -rw for word alignment (2 bytes, default alignment)
  -rl for long alignment (4 bytes)
  -rp for phrase alignment (8 bytes)
  -rd for double phrase alignment (16 bytes)
  -rq for quad phrase alignment (32 bytes)
  (wish from Rebellion Software).

- Byte and word-sized relocation in BSD format done.



04-mar-1994
-----------

- Bug fixed in padding mnemonics phrase and dphrase (Bug report from
  Loriciel).



11-mar-1994
-----------

- Warning added when assembling GPU/DSP code outside an absolute section
  (GPU/DSP code without '.org') (wish from Mike Fulton).



14-mar-1994
-----------

- Bug fixed in GASM compatibility: 'regequ' was recognized, but not
  '.regequ'.

- 'regundef' and '.regundef' directives added, for GASM backward
  compatibility.

- 'CDSP' and 'CGPU' flags added, in MadMac command line, for 'BIN/SYM'
  output.  When using these flags in MadMac command line, the source file
  cannot contain the '.TEXT', '.DATA', '.BSS', '.68000', '.GPU', '.DSP'
  directives, and external variables cannot be used, since BIN files contains
  only binary code, with a 2 longs header (execution address+code size).  Note
  that you can mix these 2 flags with 'fb' and 'g', for BSD with source level
  output, in the 'SYM' file.



21-mar-1994
-----------

- Added N_ASLINE source-level symbol.  You must now use ALN compiled at or
  after 21-mar-1994.  ORG'ed code source-level now has ORG'ed behaviour.



				22-mar-1994



- MadMac now outputs 'EQURs' as 'EQU', in the symbol table (the value is
  0x80000080L+RegNumber). This is the way RDBJAG handles register equates.



				24-mar-1994



- You can now use '.GPU' and '.DSP' directives even if you set the '-C' flag in
  MadMac command line (wish from Normen Kowalewski).

- Bug fix in the source level management! It's the bug who caused some garbage
  in the object files, sometimes ...(bug reported by John Carmack @
  ID Software, Robert Dibley @ Rebellion Software, and maybe some others).



29-mar-1994
-----------

- Bug fix in the 'incbin' function, (PC/DOS version only), when reading a
  file located in the 'MACPATH' (bug report by Nick Thompson @ Microprose UK).



30-mar-1994
-----------

- Bug fix in stored path for source-level of included files located in the
  'MACPATH'.

- Bug fix in outputing source level info for 1st line of included source
  (bug reported by Robert Dibley @ Rebellion Software).



31-mar-1994
-----------

- Added 'qphrase' directive (only '.qphrase' was handled).

- Added 'print' and '.print' directives, for printing user messages.

  examples:
    .print "toto"
    .print "toto ","titi ","tata"
    .print "illegal var. value: ",var," (should be 0>x>255)"

  You can type any string or valid expression.  If an expression is undefined,
  MadMac will output '<???>' instead of its value.  Currently, expression are
  displayed as signed longs (decimal).  If the expression is TEXT/DATA/BSS
  relative, it will be displayed as 'TEXT+x/DATA+x/BSS+x'.  Format flags may
  be added in the future, for decimal/hexa/binary, signed/unsigned, and
  byte/word/long (wish from Rebellion Software).



01-apr-1994
-----------

- Format flags added in the '.print' directive (wish from Rebellion
  Software):

   /x (hexadecimal)
   /d (signed decimal, default)
   /u (unsigned decimal)
   /w (word, default)
   /l (long)

  eg:
  MASK  .equ    $fff8
  VALUE .equ    -100000
	.print  "Mask: $",/x/w MASK," Value: ",/d/l VALUE


02-apr-1994
-----------

- Added 'autoeven/.autoeven' and 'noautoeven/.noautoeven' directives, which
  enable/disable automatic word alignment between directives/instructions.
  Default assembler mode is of course 'autoeven'.  ex:

    dc.b $12
    dc.l $345678ab
  is generated as:
    $12,$00,$345678ab
  in '.autoeven' mode

    dc.b $12
    dc.l $345678ab
  is generated as:
    $12,$345678ab
  in '.noautoeven' mode

  Note that, even if you are in '.noautoeven' mode, alignment directives are
  legals and correctly handled (.even, .long, .phrase, .dphrase, .qphrase
  directives always force the alignement, whatever is the 'autoeven' mode).
  Note too that object file sections are always aligned to 16 bits, or to the
  alignment specified with the '-r' command line flag, whatever is the
  'autoeven' mode (strange:-) wish from Nick Thompson @ Microprose UK).



03-apr-1994
-----------

- 'jump (Rx)' is now accepted (means 'jump T,(Rx)').  However, now, you
  cannot use an expression for using a condition code.  ex:

    jump EQ,(r3)                is accepted
    jump EQ+1,(r3)              is refused
    jump (EQ),(r3)              is refused

- 'jr symbol' is now accepted (means 'jr T,symbol').  However, now, you
  cannot use an expression for using a condition code.  ex:

    jr EQ,symbol                is accepted
    jr EQ+1,symbol              is refused
    jr (EQ),symbol              is refused


18-apr-1994
-----------


- Bug in JR <ccdef>,symbol. (Thanks to Robert @ Rebellion Software!).
    jr myccdef,symbol           is allowed again
- Same bug in JUMP <ccdef>,(Rn). (Thanks to Robert @ Rebellion Software!).
    jump myccdef,(Rn)           is allowed again



22-apr-1994
-----------

- Bug in macro-expanding GPU tokens:

  "r0","r1","r2","r3","r4","r5","r6","r7",
  "r8","r9","r10","r11","r12","r13","r14","r15",
  "r16","r17","r18","r19","r20","r21","r22","r23",
  "r24","r25","r26","r27","r28","r29","r30","r31",
  "cc","ae","nb","cs","b","nae","eq","e",
  "mi","s","ne","nz","pl","ns","hi","a", "nbe","t"

  are now correctly expanded. (Thanks to Virtual Xperience).



28-apr-1994
-----------

- Fixed a bug in the '.print' command: Each time an undefined symbol was
  used, '<???>' was displayed, but the symbol was stored in the object file as
  an external symbol.  Now, undefined symbols are forbidden in the '.print'
  command (bug report from Rebellion Software).



02-may-1994
-----------

- Bug fix in TEXT symbols.  There were always written in the object file as
  global symbols (bug report from Rebellion Software).

- Bug fix in the macro expansion of the ccdefs, in GPU/DSP code (bug report
  by Virtual Xperience).



06-may-1994
-----------

- Bug fix in fixing unresolved problem in .print directive.  This crashed
  with <symbol>+offset statements (Thanks to Virtual Xperience).



07-may-1994
-----------


- Unresolved problem in .print directive fixed.  (Thanks to Robert Dibley @
  Rebellion Software).



08-may-1994:
-----------

+ Added "dc.i" which stores a long in swapped format (as in MOVEI).  Was
  requested at least by Glenn Williams @ Williams Brothers.



11-may-1994:
-----------

= Changed "diesis expected" to "sharp (#) expected".  Well, in French, it's
  dièse!  (Thanks to Rob Nicholson @ HMS Ltd).



27-may-1994:
-----------

- Modified ^^time and ^^date for Atari/TOS.  Now works (Thanks to Robert
  Dibley @ Rebellion Software).


17-jun-1994
-----------

- Changed the way '^^symbols' are handled.  There should be no conflict
  between these symbols and user symbols, now.


20-aug-1994
-----------

- Bug in cargs, after which global labels were not seen any more.  Thanks to
  Scott Corley @ High Voltage.



30-aug-1994
-----------

- Bug fix in 'dc.b' and 'dcb.b' management in org'ed section (bug report by
  Mark W.  Easter @ ZCT Systems Group).

12-sep-1994
-----------

- Changed 2 error messages:

  ".equr must be defined in .gpu/.dsp section" to ".equr/.regequ must be
  defined in .gpu/.dsp section"

  "invalid GPU/DSP .equr definition" to "invalid GPU/DSP .equr/.regequ
  definition"

- Allowed .w size specification for the link mnemonic.

- Added 3 directives: .stabs,.stabd,.stabn needed for GCC back end.  They
  cannot and are not intended to be used manually.


21-sep-1994
-----------

- Changed "ABS" to "OFFSET" in .INIT error message.

- Added source-level info generation for .DC, .DCB and .INIT


2-oct-1994
------------

- Fixed a bug in outputing COMM variables in BSD object format.  MADMAC stores
  in internal its COMM labels as BSS!  So their values were added TEXT and
  DATA section sizes.  Bug report by Brian Rice.


11-oct-1994
-----------

- directives '.equr/.regequ' have been modified: You can now specify the
  bank of the register:

  toto    .equr    r3,1

  means that toto is equivalent to r3 (as before), AND that it should be used
  only in bank 1.  You can specify the current bank with the 2 new directives
  '.regbank0' and '.regbank1'.

	    .gpu
	    .org    $f03000
	_common     .equr   r20           ; can be used in any bank
	_reg0      .equr   r21,0          ; should be used in bank 0 only
	_reg1      .equr   r22,1          ; should be used in bank 1 only

	;
	; No current bank has been specified (with .regbank0/.regbank1), so
	; no warning is generated...
	;
		abs     _common
		abs     _reg0
		abs     _reg1

	;
	; Now, tell MadMac that we are in bank 0...
	;
		.regbank0
	
		abs     _common            ; no warning (_common has no bank specified)
		abs     _reg0              ; no warning (_reg0 can be used in bank 0)
		abs     _reg1              ; warning (_reg1 shouldn't be used in bank 0)
	
		movei   #$f02100,r1
		load    (r1),r0
		bset    #$e,r0
		store   r0,(r1)           ; Switch the GPU to bank 1
	;
	; Switch MadMac to bank 1...
	;
		.regbank1
	
		abs     _common            ; no warning (_common has no bank specified)
		abs     _reg0              ; warning (_reg0 shouldn't be used in bank 1)
		abs     _reg1              ; no warning (_reg1 can be used in bank 1)

		.end

  The 'MOVEFA/MOVETA' instructions handle correctly this new feature, too...

  Each time you declare a new GPU/DSP section, MadMac internal status is
  resetted to 'no default bank'.  The way this has been implemented allow you
  to assemble your old code without any new warning.  I hope this new function
  will help programmers in tracking GPU/DSP bugs:-) (I think this feature was
  required by Rebellion Software a long time ago).



13-oct-1994
-----------

- '*' and '$' expressions are now correctly handled in absolute (GPU/DSP)
  code.  ex:

    .GPU
    .ORG $f03000
    .dc.l $,$,*,$

    is assembled as:

    .dc.l $f03000,$f03004,$f03000,$f0300c

  This way, you can allocate buffers in the GPU/DSP RAM, without using any
  extra memory (as in the BSS section).  ex:

  ;
  ; Lot of GPU code
  ;
  Buffer1    .equ    *           ; Buffer1 size is $20 bytes
  Buffer2    .equ    *+$20       ; Buffer2 size is $50 bytes
  Buffer3    .equ    *+$70

  is equivalent to:

  Buffer1:  .dcb.l  ($20/4),0
  Buffer2:  .dcb.l  ($50/4),0
  Buffer3:  ...



14-oct-1994
-----------

- Added the '.fail/fail' mnemonic, which abort MadMac.  ex:

  .IF !(CRY15|CRY16|RGB15|RGB16|RGB32)
    .PRINT "No Output Format Specified."
    .FAIL
  .ENDIF

  If none of the five EQUates is non-zero, a message is displayed (.PRINT),
  and the assembling is stopped (.FAIL).  The message displayed when using
  '.FAIL' is:

  'Fatal: User abort.'

  This mnemonic is needed for GCC back-end.



19-oct-1994
-----------

- '.comm' directive is now forbidden in org'ed GPU/DSP section.

- Added '-cgcc' command line flag.  This is intended only for GCC back-end,
  and so is not displayed in the program usage.  Don't try to use it by hand!


09-nov-1994
-----------

- MadMac now tests the 'xx(a0)' <ea>, and display a warning 'Null offset in
  indirect addressing mode' if xx==0.  This works for forward and backward
  expressions.  The warning is displayed only if you set the '-s' command line
  flag, which was previously used for 'short branch warning' only.  It's now
  means 'possible optimizations warning' (Wish from Adisak L.  Pochanayon @
  High Voltage).



10-nov-1994
-----------

- Bug fix in the MC68000 assembler: overflow in 16 bits signed forward
  references was not correctly tested.  ex:

		lea farLabel(pc),a0
		rts

		dcb.b $8000,0
	farLabel:
		dc.l    0

  (Bug report by Ian Romanek @ High Voltage).


14-nov-1994
-----------

- MadMac now display the overflow distance (in bytes), in case of GPU/DSP
  relative jump overflow (Wish of Chris Oke @ Ringler Studios).


27-nov-1994
-----------

+ Added command-line option `-nl', which tells Madmac not to output
  non-global symbols.

+ Support for GCC back-end is now complete.


23-dec-1994
-----------

- Side-effect fixed when using dc.l <addr> or dc.i <addr> in orged code with
  <addr> in backward, was not marking it for reloc (Reported by Frederic Houde
  @ Ubi Soft).


13-jan-1995
-----------

- Madmac is now compiled with GCC 2.6.3.

- .lcomm directive added, for GCC back-end support.  Same restrictions as
  .comm (not allowed in GPU/DSP org'ed sections).

- .lcomm, instead of being the same as .comm, is now like:

	  symbol:       ds.b    size


19-jan-1995
-----------

- Madmac must not invert movem registers #mask if GCC back-end.  Bug report
  from Dan @ Rebellion Software.


30-jan-1995
-----------

- Madmac must believe GCC when it says "filename" and so must not append a
  .s if it has no extension.  This could only happen under PC/DOS.  Bug report
  by Ingram Leedy @ IThink.


16-feb-1995
-----------

- .lcomm'ed symbol must be defined!

22-feb-1995
-----------

- Added 'padvalue/.padvalue' directive.  Its syntax is:

	.padvalue       expression

  , where expression is a long value, which must be already defined.  This
  constant is then used as the padding value for all alignments, such as
  'even', 'long', 'phrase', ...  If the alignment needs less than 4 bytes
  (even, long), the bottom bytes of the constant are used.      ex:

	.padvalue       $12345678
	.dc.b   $55
	.even
	.dc.w   0

	is assembled as: $55, $78, $00, $00
	(requested by Dan @ Rebellion)

20-mar-1995
-----------

- The 19-jan-1995 patch was sometimes not working when used with REGs.  Bug
  report by Robert Dibley @ Rebellion.


31-mar-1995
-----------

- DOS: GO32 release 1.12m3 is now used as DOS extender.  Was crashing under
  Windows NT and probably Windows 95.  Reported and fixed by Brian McGroarty @
  High Voltage Software.
	
03-may-1995
-----------

- DOS: removed '-m486' compile option for 386 users.


24-aug-1995
--------------
- Added bitfield capabilities into MadMac.

	Syntax:

	.bfield.size	name
	x:y [, default field value]
	x:y [, default field value]
	x:y [, default field value]
	...
	.endbf

 	size can be one of the following: .b/.w/.l/.p/.d/.q
	(for byte, word, long, phrase, dphrase, qphrase)

	x:y defines the left and right bits number:
	7:4	for the high nibble of the lowest byte.

	you can define a single bit too (ex: 31:31)

	Following the 2 bits number, you can set the default value of the field.
	For example:

		7:4 , $c

	use of the bitfield:

		name	val1, val2, val3 ...

	you can omit parameters.  For example:

		name	val1, , val3

	will set only the fields val1 and val3. val2  will contain its default
	value (set in the definition), or 0 if there is no default value.

	Now, a 'real' example:

		; definition of a pixel, in RGB16 format

		.bfield.w	RGB16
		15:11			; RED
		5:0			; GREEN
		10:6			; BLUE
		.endbf


		RGB16	3, 4, 2		; RED, GREEN, BLUE

	Warning: A single field cannot contain more than 32 bits.
