This utility loads code into the Jaguar Flash ROM card.  In order to use it,
the Flash ROM card needs to be plugged into a production level Jaguar or a
developer Jaguar with a dark-green STUBULATOR rom (2-Nov-1994 or later) - no
earlier STUBULATOR can support the Flash ROM card.  Additionally you need a
Joypad connected on the Jaguar's controller port 1.  The 25-Pin connector of
the Flash ROM card connects to your PC parallel port with a 25-Pin ribbon
cable connected straight through (such as the one we use to connect PCs to
Alpine development boards).



LOADING THE FLASH ROM WITH A PRODUCTION JAGUAR
==============================================
Plug the Flash ROM card with the parallel cable connected into the Jaguar.
Some older Flash ROM's will cause the Jaguar to automatically power-on at
this point, if not, turn on the Jaguar's power.

Type in a correct command-line to the PC (see above) and hit return to start
FLASH.COM.  The program will prompt you to hold down the '3' key on the
Jaguar Joypad.  While holding down '3', hit any PC key to start the transfer
operation.  Keep it depressed until you see the message 'Erasing...' appear
on either the PC or Jaguar (some older Flash ROM cards will leave the screen
black during the whole process).

If everything is done properly, the ROM file will be uploaded to the Flash
ROM and the program will be started.



LOADING THE FLASH ROM WITH A STUBLATOR DEVELOPER JAGUAR
=======================================================
Plug the Flash ROM card with the parallel cable connected into the Jaguar.
Some older Flash ROM's will cause the Jaguar to automatically power-on at
this point, if not, turn on the Jaguar's power.

Type in a correct command-line to the PC (see above) and hit return to start
FLASH.COM.  The program will prompt you to hold down the '3' key on the
Jaguar Joypad.  On a stubulator Jaguar you will need to use a special key
sequence as follows:

1) Press and hold the '3' and 'C' buttons on the Jaguar joypad.

2) Press any key on the PC to begin the transfer process.

3) The Jaguar will reset.  At this point, release and quickly press and hold
the 'C' button while keeping '3' held down.  This will button through the
standard Jaguar Cube Intro.

Keep the keys depressed until you see the message 'Erasing...' appear on
either the PC or Jaguar (some older Flash ROM cards will leave the screen
black during the whole process).

If everything is done properly, the ROM file will be uploaded to the Flash
ROM and the program will be started.



TROUBLESHOOTING
===============
If you experience difficulties, please reread these instructions again and
make sure you've followed all of the steps correctly and are using the proper
hardware.  Some common mistakes are:

1) Downloading to the wrong parallel port.  Try the '-p1' and '-p2' switches.

2) Using a 'Blue' Stubulator ROM (dated earlier than 2-Nov-94).

3) Not holding the '3' button and/or 'C' button down at the appropriate times
as indicated above.

4) Attempting to download a non-ROM image file.
