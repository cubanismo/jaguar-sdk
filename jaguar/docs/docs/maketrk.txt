│MAKETRK - Jaguar CD Track File Maker│
└────────────────────────────────────┘

The MAKETRK utility is designed to take a single file or a number of files
and create a Jaguar CD Track File, complete with the required track header
and tailer information, and sync markers preceeding each file.

In addition to the track file, three other files will be created, a MADMAC
assembly source file containing a table of data that specifies information
about each file used to create the track file, plus both MADMAC and C
language include files with definitions for using the table.

Note that this utility is required only for Jaguar-specific code and data
tracks.  Red-Book audio tracks in session #0 of your CD do not require and
must not be processed by MAKETRK or similar utilities.

We'll presume that you are already familiar with the basics of the Jaguar CD
and things such as tracks, partition markers, and so on.  If this is not
true, please familiarize yourself with the "Jaguar CD-ROM" section of the
Jaguar Developer documentation.

│Usage│
└─────┘

maketrk [options] [filename | -l{tracklist} ]

If you do not include any options or other command line arguments, or if
you specify an option that is not recognized, then a list of available
options will be printed.


┌───────┐
│Options│
└───────┘

-b{addr} =	Specify that the track file being created is the boot track,
		and that 'addr' is the desired load address.  The {addr}
		parameter should be desired load address in hexadecimal, with
		no leading characters (i.e.  use "4000" instead of "0x4000"
		or "$4000" or "&4000H").  Must be used with the '-s' option.


-s{size} =	Specifies the amount of code and/or data to be loaded from
		the boot track by the Jaguar CD when the power is turned on.
		The {size} parameter should be the amount specified in
		hexadecimal, with no leading characters (i.e.  use "4000"
		instead of "0x4000" or "$4000" or "&4000H").  The value must
		be less than $10000.  Must be used together with the '-b'
		option.

		If {size} is not specified, then the size defaults to the
		length of the first file specified for the track.


-t{track} =	Specify the track number that will be used for the track
		header and tailer information.  The numbering starts with
		zero for the boot track (the first track on session #1 of
		your CD).  The {track} parameter should be a number from 0 to
		99.

		This option is required.  You must specify the track number.


-p{size} =	Specify padding at end of file.  The {size} parameter is
		optional.  If specified, it is a HEX value for the desired
		minimum file size.  The default size is 1 megabyte.

		This option is used to satisfy the requirements of certain
		combinations of CD Writer and CD Mastering Software, which
		may not work reliably with very short track lengths.  Note
		that the exact minimum size may vary.


-i =            Write out MADMAC source code containing a data table that
		specifies the position and length of each file in the track.

		Also write out MADMAC and C include files with equates that
		reference the entries in the data table.


-z =            Specify that a dummy word (with a value of zero) should be
		inserted at the start of the file.  (Used to force
		long-alignment of data with some CD-writer / CD mastering
		software combinations that insert their own dummy word at the
		start of the track.  Note that these 2 bytes are not included
		when the file position information is placed into the data
		table.)


-m{code} =	Specify an ASCII string up to 4 bytes long that will be used
		as the partition marker for the file used to create the
		track.  Strings less than 4 bytes long will be padded with
		spaces.  The default marker for a track file created from a
		single source file is "TRxx" where "xx" is replaced by the
		track number.  This option is ignored when using the "-l"
		option.


filename =	The name of the source file for the track.  The file will
		have the Atari approved data header and a 64-byte sync
		pattern added to the beginning of the file, and the
		Atari-approved data tailer added to the end of the file.


-l{tracklist} =	Instead of specifying a single filename on the command line,
		you can specify the name of a track list file.  This is an
		ASCII text file containing the names of the files that you
		want to use for the track, along with the unique 4-byte code
		that is used to generate a 64-byte partition marker for the
		file.  This file might look something like this:

			   ┌─────────────────────┐
			   │getopt.c        gopt │
			   │maketrk.c       mtrk │
			   │testbat.lst     BTCH │
			   └─────────────────────┘

		The filename and marker code may be separated by spaces or
		tabs.  Each line must end with a CR/LF.

		When the track file is created, a 64-byte partition marker is
		created by repeating the specified 4-byte code 16 times.  The
		marker is followed by the actual file data.  (Note that when
		you've specified track #00, the first file does not get a
		marker, because this is the boot code that will be loaded for
		you automatically.)

		If you specify a marker with fewer than 4 characters, it will
		be padded with spaces.

		If you don't specify a marker for a file, then a marker of
		the form 'xxxx' will be used, where 'xxxx' is the number of
		the file within the track, formatted with leading zeroes.
		For example, the fourth file in the track would get a marker
		of '0004'.

		It is not possible to include a file without a marker being
		placed into the output file.  If you wish to include several
		files without individual markers, then you should
		pre-concatenate them together using the DOS "copy /b"
		command, and then use the resulting file to build your CD
		track file.


┌────────────┐
│Output Files│
└────────────┘

The output files created will be named as follows.  The 'xx' portion of the
filename will be replaced by a number from 00 to 99 representing the track
number (relative to the boot track):

TRACKxx.Txx ---- Raw binary data file containing complete track data.
or               If you specify a track list file, then an output filename
inputname.Txx    of the form 'TRACKxx.Txx' will be used, where 'xx' is the
                 track number.  If you don't use a track list file, then
		 the output filename will be '<inputfile>.Txx" where 'xx'
		 is the track number and '<inputfile>' is the first part
		 of the source filename.

TRACKxx.S ------ MADMAC source code with data table defining files in track.

TRACKxx.H ------ C language header file with definitions to access data
	         defined in TRACKxx.S.

TRACKxx.INC --- MADMAC assembly version of TRACKxx.H.

│inputfile.Txx                 │
└──────────────────────────────┘

This is the main output file created by reading all of the source files
specified on the command line or within your track file list.  The layout of
this file is:

0) Word of dummy data (if "-z" option option used in command line.)

1) Atari approved data header

2) Boot Code Address & Size Fields (track 00 only)

3) 64 Byte partition marker for file (except first file of track #00).

4) Raw binary data from file.

5) If you specified a track list file, then items #3 and #4 are repeated as
   often as necessary for the complete list of files specified.

6) Atari approved data tailer.

7) Zero bytes to pad file to minimum size specified by "-p" option.  (Only
   when "-p" option used.)


┌────────────────────────────┐
│TRACKxx.S -- The Source File│
└────────────────────────────┘

The source file created has a definition for an array of data structures that
define each file used to create the track file.  Each entry has 14 bytes,
used as follows:

track: 2 bytes
starting block number: 4 bytes
length in bytes: 4 bytes
partition marker: 4 bytes

specified by the sample batch file described earlier:

┌─────┐
│Notes│
└─────┘

If you use one source file to build the track, and do not specify a partition
marker using the "-m" option, then the program will automatically use a
4-byte code like "TR00" where the last two digits are the track number.

If you use a track list file, but do not specify a marker for a particular
file, then it will use something like "0004" where the actual number used
will be the number of that file within the track. (i.e. "0004" for the 4th
file, "0007" for the 7th file, and so on.)

If you specify track #0, and do not specify the '-b' and '-s' options, you
will get an error (because this is ALWAYS the boot track).

If you specify the '-b' and '-s' options and specify a different track number
besides 0, you will get an error.

└───────┘

September 6, 1995 -- Minor changes were made to the usage() text output.

September 5, 1995 -- If you used the "-z" option to write out a dummy word
at the start of the file, and the track number was zero, and you did not
specify the length of the boot code, then MAKETRK would not work properly.
It would try to write out the size of the first file as the boot code length
in the track header, but it did not account for the extra dummy word and
would write the length two bytes earlier in the file than it should.  This is
now fixed.

September 1, 1994 -- Numerous changes made in response to feedback from Chris
Howard at Genus Microprogramming.  Some command line options have been
changed and many new ones added.

August 22, 1995 -- First external release.  The output files created are now
provided in a different format that is compatible with the upcoming tool that
will run under Microsoft Windows (est. avail. Sept. 1995)

August 11, 1995 -- First internal release.
