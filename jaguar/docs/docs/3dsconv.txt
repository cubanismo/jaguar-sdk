3DSCONV
-------
3DSCONV is a utility which converts an AutoDesk 3D Studio v2.0 or v3.0 file
into the Jaguar 3D model format.  The output is an assembly file containing
the 3D data which after assembling it can be linked with the final program.
The file name of the output file will have the file extention ".N3D".


Usage: 
	3dsconv [-f format][-l label][-o outfile][-scale scale][-textseg][-triangles][-verbose] filename

	-f format	specify output data format
	-l label	label option, assign a label
	-o outfile	assign an output file name
	-scale scale	re-scale the output vertices
	-textseg	do not output a ".data" declaration
	-triangles	do not combine faces
	-verbose	print lots of messages about what's going on


OPTIONS
-------
-f format
	Format Option. Specifies what kind of 3D file format should be
	output. `format' may be either `new' (the default), in which
	case data for the new rendering format is emitted, or
	`old', in which case data for for the old rendering format
	(as output by 3DS2JAG) is emitted. The new format is more
	efficient, but not backwards compatible.

-l label
	Label Option.  Assigns a label to the 3D data. If no label is
        assigned the default label is `_foodata', where FOO.3DS is the
	name of the input 3D Studio file.

-o outfile
	Output File Name Option. Specifies the name of the output file
	name. If this option is not given, then the output file name
	is the same as the input file name, but with the `.3DS' extension
	replaced by `.N3D' (for new format data) or `.J3D' (for old
	format data).

-scale s
	Scale Option. Allows the scale of the output points to be varied.
	`s' is a floating point number by which all coordinates will
	be multiplied. The default is 1.0; values greater than this
	will cause the model to get bigger, and less than this will
	cause the model to get smaller.

-textseg
	No Data Option. Suppresses the output of the `.data' command
	in the output assembly language, so that the compiled data
	will go in the text segment of the program.

-triangles
	Triangle Option. Suppress the combination of adjacent faces
	into quadrilaterals. If this option is given, all output
	faces will be triangles; otherwise, some adjacent triangles
	will be combined to make 4 sided polygons.

-verbose
	Print messages explaining what the program is doing. This is
	nice for reassurance while the program is converting a large
	model.
